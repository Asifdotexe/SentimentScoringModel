Perhaps it's due to the extreme angle at which I tend to hold my pen and the rhythm of my stroke, but these pens simply made a mess when I tried to write with them.  The ink is ""slippery"" and actually globbed in puddles as I wrote; the output was equally bad, whether writing in cursive or printing in block letters.

For anyone who ever built models as a hobby, you will immediately recognize this as your typical plasticard that you can get for literally $0.30 a sheet at any hobby or craft shop. The only difference is this is way smaller, has rounded corners, and an adhesive back.

I expected the adhesive to be only slightly tacky or maybe the back to have some kind of rubbery or textured coating to prevent slipping, but really it is just straight up glue. That means once you put it down, there is no removing it without ruining your desk top or spending a lot of time and effort scraping sticky residue off your desk. It can not be repositioned. My desk is brand new so I didn't want to permanently stick anything to it.

It also simply doesn't function very well as a mouse pad. I was looking for something minimalist that was designed for gamers. I tend to look for products geared toward gamers because I do a lot of photo and video editing, so it helps to have a mouse and mouse pad capable of detecting minute movements. While looking for gamer specific mouse pads, this came up but this really is not suitable for anything more than casual surfing or office use. If you're a gamer, editor, or digital artist this is not the product for you!

I have two very high quality laser mice, one regular and one ergonomic upright. I've used them before for a long time with a traditional mouse pad with no problems. I only bought this for something that is easy to clean and nicer looking. But with this mouse pad the tracking skips and settles constantly, it's extremely irritating when trying to do any detail work. Maybe it would work better with a tracker ball style of mouse? I gave this to a friend of mine who is a professional graphic designer and a Mac user, but does not have access to a tablet at her work place. She used it for a few hours, had the same problems I had, and gave it right back to me.

The bottom line is, this is a tiny piece of plasticard with a literal 3,233.333% increase in price for less material, round corners, and some tack glue. If you are near any hobby, craft, or big box store you could make a better version yourself for less than a dollar and it would only take a minute to assemble. I think this is the only time I've felt truly ripped off by a purchase and felt compelled to leave a review to warn others off of this.

Software installation would stop at 96%; hit cancel and it all uninstalls.  Spent hours on phone with HP tech support (Philippines, I think).  At one point they took remote control of my computer for 3 1/2 hours, told me to reboot and call back if there still was a problem.  There was.

After repeated uninstalls and reinstalls was able to get printer to function, but not in duplex mode.  Tech support personnel were polite and patient, wait time was short, language and understanding was sometimes a problem.

Scanning would not work using their software, however, I could scan pictures using third party programs.  The tech support guy thought that I ""should live with that"".  OCR and text scanning never would work.

More phone calls and installs and uninstalls, got it to print; intermittently in duplex mode.  Then had numerous error messages that popped up at random times and often would not cancel.  I made numerous requests to replace the printer and/or speak to a supervisor or engineer.  All requests were refused.

Now I tried email tech support (online chat never worked).  Received copius pages of links and suggestions on various alternate methods to install and reinstall.  Spent hours detailing the problems and continued to receive duplicate suggestions to fix the problems, none of which worked.

Also went on internet and googled the various error messages and software and installation problems.  Found out that most of these problems with this series of HP printers was very common and that there were few solutions offered.

- Constant print alignment problems
- Smearing
- Skipped lines
- Heavy color ink usage even though I almost never print color or pictures
- Black ink runs out fast even though I use the faded-grey draft mode for more than half my prints

The quality problems are so persistent and grievous that I can't imagine using this for business.  I use it primarily to print worksheets for my two kids, and UPS return labels.  Every time I try to use it for something where quality matters, it disappoints.

If this was truly low-initial-cost printer (40 dollar job), then I would accept getting what I paid for.  While this is still an inexpensive printer, the ink costs add up quickly and I will have to consider dumping this since it cannot print anything decently and is too costly to print casually.

Note: The printer will not print black if I select black-only if even one color cartridge is reported empty.  I'm disappointed that the Epson is deliberately set up to stop printing black just because a color cartridge is out and did not allow a workaround to print black only. Shame.

I've found the scanner produces poor image quality.  I would like to scan my children's artwork on paper, but I get better results taking a picture of it with a camera.  I suppose the scanner function works adequately if you're just using it to replace fax.

Printing can be good quality if the right ""inkjet"" paper is used so it doesn't bleed too much.  I think this is the first inkjet I've had where I won't regret having it instead of a laser printer, but I also wouldn't replace the lasers at the office with anything like this.  It's definitely a home, personal or small office, low-productivity printer, and it has limited page sizes.  Personally, the thing I miss the most is double-sided 11x17, but admittedly that is another category/price-range.

I have done some photo prints on this, which I would not plan to do regularly.  This is not a photo printer.  I used photo paper to print some proof-of-concepts for an offset print project.  The print quality was quite good, but the printer left roller marks with many tiny pin prick dents on the paper.  There may be an adjustment for this, but it's not worth it to me to figure out.  It was awkward enough just changing paper sizes and orientation with the poor user interface.  For photo printing, I still prefer a laser-exposure mini-lab type system (Fuji Frontier etc.) - In other words, I send it out to a service.

I frequently have alignment problems with the printer.  I get places on the page where the image is shifted left or right.  I've run the print head alignment utility several times but it still has alignment problems on occasion.",The printer will not print black if I select black-only ...,1423526400,6,

There are multiple problems with this cutter:
1.  No instructions are included so when you begin having problems with this cutter you have no where to turn to for trouble shooting issues.  Don't bother looking online for instructions - I already did and there are not any.

2.  This is advertised as being able to cut through 10 sheets of 20 lb. copy paper - what a joke!  I wasn't able to cleanly cut through 7 sheets of 20 lb. paper.  Only the first 3 or 4 sheets would cut somewhat cleanly.

3.  No mater how secure the paper is under the ""locked"" arm, it still shifts a little bit and when the papers are not cut the entire way through and you make another pass with the blade - it shifts and then you have slivers of paper residue and an uneven cut.

4.  You have to put substantial pressure on the cutter lever when cutting your paper but regardless of how much pressure you use - you still will NOT be able to cut the maximum amount of paper (10 sheets) as advertised.

5.  You cannot clearly see the edge that you want to cut therefore even if you cut one sheet at a time, you will be estimating your cut line.

6.  It's really hard to store due to it's bulky size - it's 12"" wide, 19.5"" long and 4.5"" high (and is only capable of cutting maybe 2 or 3 sheets of paper at a time).  Since the handle is not removable nor can it turn sideways, you have this excessive height to contend with in finding somewhere to store it.

This paper trimmer is an overpriced piece of junk.  I tried removing and reinserting the blade, I must have made 50 or more cuts just to practice and I cannot get this paper trimmer to work properly.

I bought this based on size and review.  I previously had a Samsung with a small footprint.  This is MUCH larger, much louder and frankly, seems to suck up a lot more toner.  Replacement cartridge ordered after about 2 weeks of printing mostly shipping labels on toner save mode.  Might have gotten a lemon as it started printing a set of ""cheetah-like"" dots sprinkled through each page and there's a noticeable stripe where there is no printing which the USPS counter person actually noticed.
Summary of pros and cons so far:
PRO:
-smallish footprint but still larger than I had space for
-fast - when it prints
-seems to handle ""vanilla"" document paper (weight/finish) well, both in the tray and feeder (the cheetah dots notwithstanding)

CON:
-LOUD - idle and printing sound is loud enough where I think twice about printing at night even with closed doors.
-as others point out, pages curl after print
-(update below) feeder & tray both are extremely temperamental especially for anything other than plain ol' paper.  Can't use tray for matte finish labels I bought here; the pages simply won't pull from the tray, so I hand feed ONE PAGE AT A TIME.  IN addition, can't use the tray for vellum (stuff used for overlay) regardless of vellum paper weight, glossy labels rated for laser printer.  My Samsung and OLD SCHOOL HP 6L handled both of these fine.
-if the paper inserted into the feeder is not perfectly aligned, it feeds slanted with printing coming out accordingly.
-graphics and anything less than full black text (grey tones) doesn't look great when printed
-loaded toner cartridge ran about 100 labels for shipping or even less text before the toner light went on.
ETA - was able to override after the printer stopped printing due to ""no toner"" by following one of the other 1-star reviews here.

There's more but those are the main issues.  I spent more time trying to feed paper into the single page feeder (tedious), clearing jams from the front (under the feeder/toner cartridge) and from the back.  Had no issues with printing plain docs, but that's not my main use and my old printers handled those functions far better.  It was after one of these jams that the ""cheetah"" dots appeared.  I was willing to deal because the bar codes came out unmolested and undalmation-like, but I've been able to use only about 40% of the clear labels (just text on maybe 30% of the page).  The rest are in the garbage.

I'm getting the replacement unit soon (if UPS or whoever deigns to deliver on time, again with 1 day shipping).  I'll try to update.  Hopefully I just got a lemon unit.

-------
UPDATE - looks like the initial unit I received was a QC-escapee:
Got a replacement unit from Amazon.  The replacement unit has performed as follows:
-no problems connecting
-unlike the initially shipped unit, tray feeding works with all the papers (matte finish label, gloss, gloss clear).
-printing quality was OK initially.  Occasional dots at intervals.  Not sure what is causing this but the issue seems to come and go with coinciding faint ink smearing.  See more issues like missed areas when printing in ""toner saver"" mode.

Not perfect but adequate.  The best use of this is for just plain document (text) using 24lb paper.  Not likely to buy another Brother printer.  Have not had these issues with previously bought HPs (laser, color laser, color inkjet) and Samsungs.",Chucking it after 6 months,1355875200,,

I ran out of ink trying to clean the printhead...bought 2 new ink cartridges and tried again...didn't work.

I contacted Kodak and because it was still under warranty, they replaced the print head.  The new print head worked but because I didn't use the printer on a weekly basis, the print head clogged again in a couple of months...used up both cartridges to try to clean it but ran out of ink again.
Because my warranty expired, I went online to find a solution...found a website that discussed cleaning a clogged printhead.  I ran through the process a couple of times, purchased another set of ink cartridges and did the cleaning cycle...black print was illegible and color photos looked like ghosts and zombies.  I did another clean cycle and was able to watch the ink disappear from the cartridges with the onscreen monitor.  I was shocked to see how much ink was being used in the cleaning process!

Kodak might advertise low prices for their cartridges but they don't hold much ink.  You could easily use up a quarter of the cartridges during the cleaning process if that works at all.

But, anyways.. do not be fooled into thinking these are the best pencils in the world.. if you want those, save up and buy a pack of Prismacolor pencils.

Edit.
After being sharpened three times, one has completely split in half. 4 have had broken lead the look like I have been using then non stop for a month. And the coverage if these is awful.  Those that love these have either been paid to write fake reviews or got them at a discount or don't know any better.. I have never ever had a good quality pencil break on me and I have been coloring longer then it has been popular. Again AVOID THESE AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE.","they aren't all they are ""cracked"" up to be. Worse then crayola.",1491350400,7,

Blue/black is a color I like.

The color is good, and shading is solid, there's actually some gorgeous dark red sheen when you lay it down crazy wet, but this ink is HORRIBLY behaved.

I did find a use for this ink, and it's in a brush pen. Just fill a brush pen with blue/black and you have a contrasting blue/grey to solid black with deep red sheen depending on how wet you lay it down.

Right out of the box, the scale did not function properly.  The display kept showing wildly inaccurate and ever-changing weights; after about a minute, I detected a burning odor.  This may have been a ""lemon"" unit, 1 out of 1,000 that work properly.
But I had red-flags even before I used the scale:

1.  The item was delivered in an outer Amazon box with air bubbles.  The unit itself was housed in its own cardboard box that fit securely around it, but with NO foam packing or bubble wrap.  As this product is a SCALE (!) I expected packaging better suited to the item at hand.  Whether this issue led to my unit's malfunction I'll never know.

2.  The user manual is very brief, poorly worded and no help what-so-ever.  It is painfully apparent that the person who wrote the manual has only token / basic understanding of the English language.

3.  The front function board looks cheap.  It is a laminated white panel - ""press"" style.  Those ""press"" function buttons are your ONLY options with this device.

4.  Does NOT include an AC Adaptor.

4.  I bought an official US Postal Service Postal Scale about 10 years ago -- that little jewel was around $40 bucks, but it lasted until about 1 month ago.  I've now been in the market for a new postal scale.  The UNIT from ""Weightmax"" is a TOTAL KNOCK-OFF  -- it is the exact same shape and size, the display is identical, just the 'functions' panel is a little different.

And the amber ""Error"" light on the control panel kept flashing. And the printer made a horrid grinding/groaning sound at startup.

I tried everything from a printer hard reset to spooling directly to the printer. Nothing worked. Every time I put the OEM Canon cartridge back in, the printer functioned normally again. If I then put the compatible cartridge back in, the problems returned.

I was sent a replacement cartridge by LINKYO. It did the same thing.

Apparently the chip in these LINKYOs cannot fool my MF236n printer (that calls for a Canon137 cartridge in the user's manual). That probably means it won't fool the printer's siblings either: MF244dw, MF247dw, MF249dw. See other reviews confirming this ""Cartridge Communication Error;"" there's a good bit of evidence that the current technology in these printers is pretty successful at defeating non-OEM cartridges. Thanks Canon.

To be fair, I used LINKYO toner cartridges (#128) in my prior printer (MF216n) and there were never any chip issues. I would say that five times out of six, the cartridge performed well in terms of print quality, cartridge life, etc.

I suppose this chip cat-and-mouse game never ends. Eventually the compatible chip technology will evolve to outsmart the printer. But for now at least you can't use this cartridge in the printers I listed above.","Won't work in MF236n, MF244dw, MF247dw, MF249dw Canon printers.",1527292800,,

And with the built in Wi-Fi you can now jam paper wirelessly.

""But wait,"" you say. ""Why would I want to spend 2/3 of my day trying to dislodge bits of paper with tweezers from between the tiny teeth of a roll bar while holding a flashlight in my mouth?""

But the clock on the Brother MFCJ625DW will assure you that it's only 10:30 am, no matter how many times you reset it. It's like *gaining* 6 hours every single day.

With the Brother MFCJ625DW, your paper jam issues will compound exponentially the more you use the printer.

They've cleverly hidden all the places paper can actually get stuck behind immovable walls of cheap plastic and metal teeth. There's a compartment in the back that allows the majority of the paper to be extracted, but don't worry - no matter how gently you extract it, there will always be tiny bits left behind for you to find. Think of it as a micro-scavenger hunt that ends with you slashing your wrists in frustration. At this price point? That's a bargain and then some!

Laptop users will especially enjoy the Brother MFCJ625DW. The marathon paper jams forever eradicate that pesky sense of freedom and portability you enjoy with longer laptop battery life and wi-fi connectivity. That's right, the Brother MFCJ625DW can jam paper no matter where you print from. This means you'll need to constantly move from your location back to the printer to fix the jam (don't forget your tweezers). It's great exercise, as is writing out your report, paper, or thesis by hand, just like your great-grandmother used to do. After you realize that no matter what you do, what type of paper you use, or what god you pray to, there is simply no way the Brother MFCJ625DW is ever going to successfully print without jamming, you can finally give up on the notion of productivity, creativity, and free time to spend with loved ones. But don't worry, the endless ""spooling"" messages that appear - on the rare occasion the printer actually communicates with you in anything other than arcane error codes - will give you a feeling of productivity that lasts, literally for hours.

A comment left on this review made me raise an eyebrow and take a closer look. Joining me was a long time friend who spent his career with Natuzzi leather. It's absolutely NOT leather. Research on the Net confirms that fake leather has become so hard to distinguish from real that the majority of even knowledgeable consumers can't tell the difference. Here's a quote from ehow dot com.

""There is nothing more infuriating then paying big bucks for leather furniture or clothing and realizing you have been duped when it is too late. There is a real racket for faux leather and sometimes you can't tell for sure what you are paying for.""
ehow.com

I contacted the seller who in turn contacted the manufacturer and I was told it was Bonded Leather. Bonded leather is made from ground up scraps of leather, mixed with a polymer and pressed in a mold to make the grain. It doesn't perform, breath, last or age like leather because it isn't leather. There's nothing wrong with advertising a piece of furniture as ""Bonded Leather"" it can look great and costs a fraction of a simmilar item made of real leather. However it's deceiving to advertise this chair as leather.

""Soft Touch"" leather is what we in Advertising call ""weasel words"". They're marketing phrases and they're meaningless. You want to see ""100% Leather""  "" Genuine Leather"" or the nature of the Hide such as ""Lamb Skin"" printed on the label.

No label?  it's not leather.

The Mechanism.

The height adjustment lever is easy to use and silent. To adjust the back a lever would have been a nice touch and they're certainly more convenient to use. Instead there's a tension knob under the seat which you have to turn to adjust how far the back will lean and how much give it will have. So expect to get in and out of the chair multiple times to get the sitting position you want.

Assembly

Over the past 30 years, I must have assembled a dozen of these. They're never effortless. The chair comes with clear directions and a small Allen Wrench, grab a Phillips head screwdriver and you're good to go. Expect to spend around an hour putting it together - leave final tightening of all screws until you're finished.

Because so many of the screws are driven into plastic be careful not to over tighten and avoid using an electric drill with a Phillips bit or electric screwdriver as I have no doubt you'll strip the threads.

Build Quality.

Not very sturdy - there is movement and give where you would rather it be sound and solid. But it's far from terrible and pretty much a non issue.

The Bottom Line.

If this was a leather chair it would be a sensational value. For a Fake leather chair this is anything but. Comparable chairs sell both on and off Amazon for around $79 - $129.

The selling of this chair is an example of ""Bait and Switch""  I won't accept that -  not on any level.  I'll be returning the chair.",Fake Leather - Fraudulant Advertising - Poor Value,1336608000,49,

I got my first replacement cartridges within a couple of weeks, I think.  It's mid-November, and I'm just now at low-ink status with my original cartridges.  I went online to check the status of my instant ink thing, thinking I would start my free trial period when I put in my replacement cartridges that I got (back in the summer).  Nope, turns out I've been getting billed for the past several months, because I signed up.  Not because I'd started using the instant-ink cartridge they sent me, but just because I'm in the program at all.  I get that maybe I should be checking my statements, but I have a lot of things going and not a lot of time...whole other issue.

When I went to cancel my enrollment in Instant Ink, the UI was going to make me check boxes that I acknowledged, among other things, that I would be ***billed one more month***, and that ***after the month is over my instant-ink cartridges would stop working.***  Hello, landfill!?!?

The reason I haven't needed all of the refills until now is that I am not a heavy printer.  I save PDFs rather than print, when I can help it.  I feel that the sign-up process is pretty misleading, and that I never should have been billed for the past few months, since I've never opened up my first set of instant-ink cartridges.  I thought my free few-months trial started after I started using the first shipment of replacement ink.  That's how the signup process read to me.

Bottom line, I recommend against using this program unless you're a moderate or heavy printer.  Those of us trying to be paperless (or close to it) get ripped off.

I figured this would be an improvement on their older model, the CWP-206, but it takes longer to create an answer list.

The time it takes goes up dramatically the farther into the word that your first known letter sits. It took the CWP-206 only one second to finish searching for the word ""harem"" with the first letter a wildcard, but took 8 seconds to finish on the SA-309. ??REM took less than 4 seconds for the CWP-206 to produce five words, and 37 seconds on the SA-309 to produce only two words. If you start to try longer words with more front-end letters missing, it gets so slow as to be unusable.

What really annoys me is that it seems like they removed a lot of answers that were specific to solving difficult crosswords - certain terms, first/last names, or short phrases you would not normally find in a dictionary. My best guess is that they used a smaller crossword solver database to make more room for the spellchecker and thesaurus, the primary functions of the device given the ""SA"" product prefix.

Giving Franklin one more chance, I considered purchasing the slightly more expensive CWP-570, which I figured would be the real upgrade I was looking for. I was shocked to find the reviewers there had the same complaints. Through my searches I also found that Franklin used to sell it as the NYT-570CWD, with the New York Times logo printed on it, but must've realized the folly of their ways and removed the reference. They're so full of other useless games and features that the main selling point seems like an afterthought.

Over the last few years I've finished thousands of New York Times crosswords and, like others, have found Franklin's (sadly discontinued) CWP-206 to be one of the best solvers around. There is also a more compact CWP-106. If you can't find either of those used, I would recommend Seiko's line of crossword puzzle solvers, ER3200/ER3700/ER6700. They can be found on Amazon (I found the ER3200 for $35), but it may take some time to find a reasonable price since they're usually coming from the UK/Ireland.

I only had it a short time.  I still stand by my comments that the picture quality on prints and cd/dvd's is unmatched by any other printer I own or have owned but now I must qualify it by saying ..AS LONG AS IT WORKS.

After several months, one of the print heads went bad.  I tried numerous times to clean it and even tried new ink cartridges to no avail.  I contacted Epson support and after having me try a few tests, they sent me a replacement and I was truly happy.  I figured I got a lemon the first time and now it would be fine.  Last week, the yellow print head went bad, same thing.  I called and they said it was out of warranty.  I haven't had it a year, so I assume they base the warranty on the date of the original purchase only and not how long you actually have the printer.  Bottom line, in a total of 15 months, I have had two of these printers and both have failed.  Pretty short life.  It's like expensive rent for a printer.

Yesterday I went to the Epson website and wrote a review saying what I just wrote above.  Today I got the following email from Epson:

""Your opinion is very important to us and the Epson America community. We appreciate you taking the time to write a review on Epson Artisan 50 Inkjet Printer. Unfortunately your review did not meet our guidelines for posting on our site.""

I guess Epson only posts favorable reviews on their site.  It's too bad, because I do love their print quality but I can't deal with their unreliability.

1.0,False,"08 10, 2005",A2QMYQ000ZXDKV,B0009AFVZK,,Bruce_R,"My experience is nearly identical to Jack Levin's. I bought the phone at a national office supply store for 59.99. Great price, and all the features I wanted--2 lines, caller ID on both lines, lots of memory locations to store numbers, voicemail lights, and a switchable data port, so you can use line 1 or 2 to send and receive faxes. I thought the price for all these features was wonderful.

Caller ID worked fine, that is until I wired my jack for 2 lines. Initially, I had only my ""home office"" number hooked up. I then wired the jack so the second line would be my personal home extension. Once I did this, caller ID broke. It says ""Waiting for caller information"" even after 6 rings. All other phones in the house pick up the caller ID info after 1 ring.

I called support at the number on the bottom of the phone-I was lucky to find it. I didn't find the on the [...]website, nor was it in the manual. Once I called, I was almost sorry I did. I swear I spoke with the dumbest person on the planet-No joke. Even after I explained that I had plugged other phones into each line and the caller ID info is always displayed after 1 ring, she said that my phone company doesn't transmit the ID info until after the 4th ring, and that since my Verizon voicemail service that I subscribe to was picking up after 4 rings, that it would not work. So I called into voicemail and changed it to 6 rings before vm answers. I told her that I wanted to test again, and then she said that the change to my voicemail would take up to 24 hours to process. So I insisted that we test her theory, and it rang 6 times (go figure) and went into voicemail. No caller ID info appeared, as usual. She said that my particular unit must be defective. So I took it back and exchanged it for the same model. Same issue. The phone just doesn't work as designed to handle caller ID when 2 lines are connected.

I did some additional testing to see if using both input jacks instead of just 1 would fix the issue. There are 2 input jacks on the back. The first can be used for line 1 & 2 or just line 1, and the second is just for a single line, line 2. So you have the option of using a 4-wire cable to a jack wired for 2 extensions (using the first input jack only), or plugging into 2 separate wall jacks (using both input jacks). I plugged in a line splitter, which plugs into the wall and provides separate line 1 and line 2 recepticles. When I plug one cord into either singly line, and into the phone (either port on the phone) the caller ID works fine. If I plug 2 cords into the phone, each connected to a separate line, caller ID breaks.

I am returning the phone tomorrow and will purchase the more expensive RCA phone ($85) with basically equivalent features. That phone is model GE-25202RE3. Hopefully I have better luck with that unit.

I loved the phone until I had the second line wired. I would have given it 2 or 3 stars, but the support was so pathetically poor that I must give it the lowest score possible. If zero stars were an option, that would be my rating after my painful support experience.",Caller ID does not work with 2 lines,1123632000,4,

- AC Adaptor never worked...would not seat properly even with me trimming the plug down.  My boyfriend has to solder stuff for our business.  So he took a look and it was all wrong so he ended up hardwiring the power cord.

- Was not able to get the batteries to work...plus not practical as we use the scale daily for mailings

- The little button on the side to switch from grams, ounces and pounds came undone (it's backmounted...snap in).  This scale is really sensitive so you have to be careful and reset if it jumps from grams to pounds, etc.  Well, ended up just popping open the unit (not easy to do) and snaking the little button and taping it to the front.  Otherwise, I'd have to pry open the bottom or leave it dangling to do the reset routine.

- Finally, the callibration is all off.  I almost vastly overpaid for an Express Mail International package.  Luckily, postal clerk caught it.  And weighed on two scales to double check.  Plus I used my manual old-fashioned scale to triple-check.  In order to calibrate, you must have 10 gram weight.  Now who has a 22 lb weight around?  Yes, I thought about stacking some food products to calibrate.  But it's so messed up so might as well try for  replacement (see below).

Final notes, it was cheap and we were able to do our own fixes and it has lasted 2 1/2 years.  It was also accurate.  The detachable part was handy for really big packages.  Now going to try a warranty/replacement (myweigh DOT com/warranty-instructions).  I have all the paperwork My Weigh needs in Phoenix, AZ.  Fingers crossed.  So one star because I have no choice.

The 'power saving' mode cuts off the connection to the computer, which means you need to recycle the power EVERY TIME YOU USE IT (unless you use it every 15 minutes).

If the printer every gets powered off for more than a few minutes, you need to re-enter the password for the network.

Contacting customer service about the problem was a huge pain and when it finally happened the lady on the other end was less-than-knowledgeable about the printer.  She was nice enough to act helpful as she read the exact same pages to me from the manual that I had already read 15 times!  She was professional in her cluelessness, however, which is something few people do anymore.

All-in-all, it might be an okay printer for home with these issues, but for a work environment IT IS FRUSTRATING.

Bottom line?  I wouldn't buy it again, and wish I had realized it wasn't a network problem on our end (as the technical help at Brother said it was) before the 30-day return period was up.

UPDATE: I've contacted Brother 10 times now about the problem. All have said it's a problem with our network (Apparently our network has a secret bug that prevents Brother printers from finding it again after it's gone into a deep sleep, but it lets all other wifi printers connect...evil network), and all have given the same script for 'fixing' the problem.

My husband and I really liked them, but after only 2 months, the screw in the side broke - it is a very fragile screw, not very strong, and it broke off inside the other tube so that there is no way to get it out or fix it. I am sad to look through reviews now and see many others have the same problem. I contacted KeySmart hoping for an easy replacement or repair - I had read one review where someone said KeySmart replaced their faulty product, so I thought it would be easily remedied. But instead, I got the run around. At first the guy sounded nice and said they'd be glad to resolve the situation, but he kept telling me to use my finger or use an eraser to try to remove the broken off screw! After 7 emails I finally complained about the customer service and asked if a refund was possible and of course now they are silent and ignoring me. I've been very courteous and nice about the matter until the end when I had enough. I don't recommend these unless you make sure to be very careful with them, they aren't very durable, and the customer service is poor. Also I noticed a review that mentioned that when it broke on them, all their keys fell everywhere, and they were afraid they might have lost something.

The printer recognizes them fine, but the print quality is terrible - it's almost like the cartridges dried up in a warehouse somewhere and the ink isn't flowing.  I am pretty technically inclined and aligned the heads, primed the heads, performed a bunch of maintenance tasks, but zip.  I tried two different cartridges and neither worked, so am returning the entire pack of 10.

I have used generic cartridges before with good effect, so I'm not someone who's stuck on Epson... I think Epson cartridges are ridiculously overpriced... but at least they work!

Pass these and try some other generics that work, or go with name brand if you can.  I'm going to try others and will update this review if I find some on Amazon that work.

Good luck!  (you'll need it if you order these!)

UPDATE 8/19:
These cartridges clogged the print heads on my printer and even when I replaced them with standard Epson cartridges, the printer would not print the colors I had used the generics on (yellow and cyan).  I literally have to throw out the printer and start over.  BE WARNED.  Also, I find it INTERESTING that all of the FIVE STAR reviews on this page this is the ONLY item the reviewer has ever reviewed.  Seems very suspicious to me.  This is NOT user error - these are BAD CARTRIDGES.  I have used other generics in the past with no issue, so am not necessarily advocating using branded ink, just saying, avoid these!

Well it is now 3 years later and my receipt service no longer supports quickbooks integration so I thought, ""hey, they must have gotten all the bugs worked out by now, lets give them another chance"".  Wow, was that a mistake.  The software launched correctly one time.  That's right, one time.  I got it to scan in a few receipts which it had less than 50% accurate data reading. I shut it down I could never get it to run again.  Neat couldn't help, no amount of configuration settings would work.  No help online either.  My system is a very stable windows 7 machine that runs any piece of software I can throw at it, except for the neat software.  So I boxed it up and sent it back.  Trust me when I say I will NEVER buy another Neat product as long as I live.

Oh, and if you are looking for a desktop solution, look elsewhere.  Neat is switching everything to cloud based service and the local software will not be supported after March 31, 2016.  When you buy the system you don't get a disk, you get a code to download the software from the neat website.  You will get the newest software that is, you guessed it the cloud based software.  And if you want to import into quickbooks, you will now have to pay $9 a month for that.  It no longer will be part of Neat desktop and is no longer free.

1.0,True,"12 11, 2011",A36U9P1BA07210,B001Q3KMUI,,Henry A. Kim,"The printer is fantastic:  it is quite fast and print quality is mindblowing, at a very low cost!  Remanufactured toners are fairly cheap, if you look for deals, although they run out kind of fast--but that is to be expected, I think, for a color laser--you shouldn't be using this for everyday bw prints if you could help it.  Having been using this for a couple of months, though, I found a couple of very annoying quirks.  First, it is quite noisy.  In fact, it makes so much creaking noise sometimes that it sounds like it's about to die.  Second, installing new toners can be quite tricky:  getting the right side of the toner, especially, to fit snugly into its rightful place is pretty hard.  If the toners aren't seated just right in the rotary unit, the printer will immediately jam up with a loud and unsettling clanking noise and you need to call the tech support for instructions on how to unjam it (Konica Minolta tech support is very helpful, though), which can be a bit headachy for the technologically uninitiated (as I found the hard way), although eminently doable once you know how, since, apparently, the printer is designed to be easy to take apart and replace parts as necessary.  Depending on how badly the rotary unit is jammed, you may need to pretty much take apart everything inside the printer.

The quality and price of the printer deserve five stars, but the annoying quirks are worth perhaps -1 star, although, if you are handy enough with printers, it shouldn't be a big deal.

EDIT:  Well, after having used the printer for a while, some more annoying quirks have shown up.  First, it seems that some parts are quite fragile--although it may have been due to somewhat intensive use on my part.  The fuser unit is supposed to be rated for 50,000 prints, but I noticed that the roller vinyl on mine has melted in a few places already after having printed less than 1/5 of that.  One should be careful to limit its use at any one time, it seems.  Second, I found replacement toners to be much bigger source of headache as time goes on.  The ""chip"" in cartridges, it seems, imposes serious restrictions on getting cheap replacement toners--which are liable to give you ""cartridge not installed errors"" with alarmingly high probability.  Third, while this is true for almost any laser printer, replacement parts are disturbingly expensive--in my case, I've gotten another KM printer of this model as a replacement hulk, not buy individual replacement parts.

While disappointing these are, though, I don't consider these enough to lower the rating below 4 stars.  It is still a cheap printer that works well, certainly no worse than its competition.  You just shouldn't expect it to last too long, though.

Edit #2:  After having been using the printer for a while, the printer seems to be looking worse and worse.  The prices have been jacked up quite a bit:  it used to be possible to get one on sale for about 80-100 bucks, which would have made it an unbelievable bargain.  Now, at 139 bucks, while still inexpensive, it's not quite the bargain, and its negatives are becoming more of a concern.  If the printer works, it's terrific.  But, if it doesn't quite work right, you'd be in for a load of trouble, and the documentation is extremely spotty and the customer service has gotten vastly worse over just past year so that you can't really get help.  One common problem, it seems with this printer (not uncommon with other printers, too) is that it will almost certainly give you ""memory full"" errors when you set it up.  I apparently completely forgot about the problem, which I apparently dealt with without thinking about it when I first installed the machine way back when, until I tried to set it up with my new computer the other day.  After setting it up, I could not get anything to print.  So, after searching the internets for a while, I've found someone claiming to have dealt with the problem by updating firmware:  a big mistake!  NEVER update firmware on this machine because they are more trouble than it's worth.  The firmware updates basically made the printer dysfunctional:  the printer no longer prints anything sent from the computer, although it can print test patterns stored on itself.  Basically, it still works fine as a printer...but no longer talks to the computer.  There is nothing in any of their documentations about how to deal with situations like this, like resetting firmware to factory defaults--assuming it is even possible.  Talking to their customer service nowadays is no longer possible because there is seemingly no way to get to them at any realistic hour (and their ours of operation are nowhere to be found--which means I had to call them half a dozen times before I got through to a live person, who hung up on me after I asked for a clarification--no indication of when they are open in the recorded message that they are closed either.)  Apparently, Konica Minolta has fairly recently consolidated and centralized its customer service operation:  it can no longer be contacted at normal hours and it is  now apparently full of rude and incommunicative people who will hang up on you if you say something.

To the degree that the printer works, it may still be a worthwhile buy.  But the probability of something going wrong seems high enough and dealing with these problems is so headachy that, unless the printer is truly dirt cheap, it's not worth it--and since the printer is not exactly ""dirt cheap"" any more, you may want to think twice.  Plus, I think Konica Minolta people need to be taught a serious lesson for the way they mistreat their customers.","If it works, it's very good.

PROS:
*  The printer is Beautiful and seems to be built well at first glance but many Reviews say they've had many problems. Also, the price seems fair only for those that know how to get it working in less than 1/2 hour. For all those that had to waste an entire day trying to make it work and must waste more time and effort returning it for refund - not only is it worthless but Cannon owes me money.

CONS:
* EVEN IF YOU ARE MECHANICALLY INCLINED you may break the machine trying to figure out how the ink cartridges are installed. Get this - a secret compartment opens for the ink cartridges only when the machine is turned on and cycles through. Once the secret door is open you still have to waste time and fiddle with things to install the cartridges....HOW STUPID IS THAT FOR CANNON NOT TO STATE THIS UPFRONT IN THE INSTRUCTIONS!!  ALSO, the Instructions say to remove the Tape from the cartridges before installation but the cartridges have two layers of tape. First layer comes off easy and makes sense to remove. The 2nd layer seems like it was meant not to be removed because it sticks on so tight so now you are left to guess what to do. I did not remove that tape in fear I'd cause permanent damage to the cartridge.

*  IF YOU ARE NOT TECH SAVVY GOOD LUCK.

December 2008 - I purchased this printer specifically for the separate, archival ink cartridges. Setup via WiFi went smoothly with the Tiger on iMac, but has been spotty for our Windows XP Pro machine. XP often ""loses"" the printer's signal and it usually has to be rebooted to see it again. I was very happy with the photo print quality, and love the separate ink cartridges, but scanning using the HP software was abominably slow and settings wouldn't stick. I switched to using Vuescan like I had before and saw some improvement, although it is still much slower than my previous scanner via USB or WiFi.

June 2009 - the touchscreen started behaving erraticly. It would work sometimes, but not others. As soon as an error occurred (jam, no paper, whatever), it couldn't print anymore because you couldn't touch the OK button. After a few weeks of turning the printer off and on, I called HP. Over a 3 day period, I went through several diagnostics, and special reboots with very polite people in India, but no fix. The printer was replaced with a refurbished unit within a week. Returning the broken one was quick and easy with a prepaid label.

However, there are some wonky issues with the refurb:
The CD/DVD door is loose and rattles open when printing in Fast Draft mode.
When the paper tray gets down to 3-5 sheets, it tries to grab all of them and jams.
The 4x6 tray won't print unless there is paper in the other tray.
The ink does not lay down as smoothly in photo printing, color or B&W. You can actually see the dots of ink, rather than smoothness. I looked at prints from the original C8180 and they are much smoother. I'm hoping this resolves when I switch to retail cartridges (the refurb came with new Starter inks). If not, I'll be contacting HP again.

October 2009 - Snow Leopard upgrade has the C8180 drivers already installed, so I haven't had to dig up the CD. Photo printing is still not as smooth as the original. I'll be getting new cartridges soon - I haven't printed as much with the refurb.

December 2009 - the WiFi has failed on the replacement refurb, and the 4x6 tray refuses to pull paper, print quality hasn't gotten any better with new cartridges or new paper. HP Support ran through several diagnostics and got the WiFI running, but now the print quality of photos is atrocious. Blotches abound, particularly in the Magenta and Black colors. I have replaced all cartridges AND bought new paper. After several weeks of back and forth emails, HP Support politely refused to replace the unit even though I was told the refurb came with a 1 year warranty (and this round of problems started before my original warranty was up).

Late January 2010 - This morning, the scanner froze up and all lights on the unit started blinking, so I'm left with a unit that can only print 8.5x11 plain paper when it feels like it, when I purchased a PHOTO printer with scanning capabilities.","Poor quality, won't last long",1256601600,2,

I have been in the market for a home laser printer for my art and event distributions to avoid costly printing expenses elsewhere.  I thought it would be perfect for my small scale needs.

The packaging was good.  Nothing was damaged when the printer arrived.  However, as other reviewers have stated, the printer does NOT come with the USB cable which you HAVE to have to connect it to the printer.  Fortunately, I have a scanner which uses the same size cable so I just used that.

The printer is loud when preparing to print or powering up, but I didn't really care about that.

I printed a test run on regular paper and it worked ok.  The printer took about 30 seconds to grab the paper in the tray.  While it was printing, it sounded like it was eating the paper.  To me, as long as the print quality is good, I didn't care about the noise.

The print quality was outstanding for a home printer.

Then things started going down hill.  It started taking forever to grab the paper.  The lights would start blinking and then the error indicator would blink. I would press the Ready Button (the only button aside from the power switch) and it would attempt to grab paper again - unsuccessfully.  I went through this over and over until I just had to start hand feeding it paper.

I needed to print on heavier paper.  So I had some lowgrade cardstock.  The printer grabbed it for a while, printed about 20 pages and then stopped - the lights were blinking again.

It thought it was out of toner.  It wasn't out of toner.  I took the toner out, put it back in and it still wasn't happy.  So I powered the printer off, waited 10 seconds and turned it back on.  It STILL thought it was out of toner.  I eventually figured out that we had to disable the ""stop printing if toner is low"" feature on the program on the computer.

It printed a few more pages and then just stopped printing alltogether.  It seemed to think that it was out of paper or there was a misfeed.  I opened it up countless times, powered it off and on, tried different settings, tried curling the paper, tried different papers... nothing worked.

After 1 hour of hand fed printing, I had about 30 copies done and a dead printer.  A brand new printer just sitting there, doing nothing.

So, I called Konica while I was on my break at work.  Big mistake.  They didn't even want to help me.  They demanded information that I didn't have one me - all I kept asking for were some trouble shooting techniques.  The lady was extremely rude and eventually hung up on me.  I called again today before finally returning the product and had a similar experience.

When you consider how easy it is for organizations and individuals to spoof caller id numbers using VOIP (Internet enabled phones), it makes better sense to plan a list of numbers such as family, friends, doctors, pharmacies who you do  want to receive calls from and send the rest of the calls to voicemail.  If someone who should get through gets sent to voicemail, just listen to their message and add them to the whitelist.

With a blacklist, it is an endless game of whack-a-mole.  You will  never win with a blacklist, but a whitelist is far more effective for home use.  For a business, this would probably not work well since the whitelist is limited to 100 numbers.  In this day, why couldn't they just add an SD slot on this device to expand memory to make larger whitelist???

UPDATE:  8/15/2016

I decided to return this item today because it doesn't really function at all.  Originally I thought it worked well for the following reasons.  I have a OBITalk 202 VoIP box with two google voice lines registered to it.  Before I purchased the box I had a white filter setup on Google Voice but 2 out of every 10 calls pass through Google's Voice filters so I thought the CPR Call Blocker Protect White List Call Blocker would be a good second level ""firewall"" against annoying telemarketing calls.  The calls that were being filtered were filtered out by Google and not the CPR Call Blocker.  I looked at the history of my Google Voice to see which calls were in fact intercepted by Google and not CPR.  It seemed all of the calls that were intercepted were stopped by Google.

Now for my biggest problem with this device.  Like many other reviewers have stated and I should have taken their reviews more seriously, all of my calls were being blocked by CPR, including the numbered I entered into the whitelist.  I tried to connect the device using every method described in the user guide, and I used an old POTS wired dial tone phone to make sure it wasn't my wireless phone interfering.  No matter which way I connected my line and telephones,  (L)ine1  (T)elephone1  or (L2) (T2) or (L1) (T2) or (L2) or T1)  ....all four possible combinations, the device would still block every number.  I tested this out repeatedly over and over by calling myself using my cell phone and my second line on the obitalk.  Re-entering over and over my numbers into the whitelist but the results were the same.,  While the company does state it can add your whitelist remotely, for me this isn't practical since I would have to call them all the time to add new numbers.

It is an easy read and leads one to believe it will be a nice introduction to helping a person build a relationship with Christ. What is does for many people is it replaces time in the Bible with the reading of this book. After a careful read my self I see that, Sarah Young, perhaps wanting a word from God that was more than the Word of God, she ended up being deceived herself. ""Deceiving and being deceived: 2 Tim 3:13, and she has taken millions of Jesus Calling readers along with her. Remember I Tim 4:1 "" Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons."" The writer has made millions of dollars by steering people away from the Word of God (the Bible) and towards Jesus Calling. An example of a misrepresentation that I found on two separate pages that contradict the Bible's true Jesus Christ.  Supposedly she was told by her ""Jesus"" that the last words he spoke after his resurrection and before ascending into heaven were ""I am with you always.""  But the statement made by the true Jesus Christ on the Mount of Galilee were not His last words before ascending into heaven.  His last words were spoken from the Mount of Olives as recorded in Acts 1:7-9, 12. The 2 messages Sarah Young received from her ""Jesus"" contradict the words of the true Jesus Christ in the Bible. Regardless of whether the writer has been listening to a deceptive spirit (I Tim. 4:1) or to her own confused thoughts (1 Corinthians 14:33) or a combination of both, she is misguided and is in turn deceiving others (2 Tim 3:13) whether she realizes it or not.  Believers must search the Scriptures for themselves to see if the things they are being told are really true (Act 17:11) and they must test the voices they are listening to ""because many false prophets are gone out into the world"". 1 John 4:1).  It is not enough that a teaching makes a person feel good if it is not based upon the truth of the Bible, then it is to be avoided.  Unfortunately, believers who are not well versed in the scriptures will not be able to catch untruths and deceptions when presented to them.

Slip the picture in the top like a toaster, push the door closed, and scan.  It even uses the USB cable for power:  no kludgy AC adapters to snake behind the desk and find a slot for on your overburdened power strip.

Unfortunately, nothing else about the VuPoint makes it worth this little amount of effort:  there are no Windows 7 drivers.  The Vista drivers are 32-bit only.  The XP drivers will work on XP, at which point you'll discover that the 'scan' quality is extremely poor.  If I want to scan family photos, I'm not going to demand that decades-old paper gets tons of quality from a device that costs this little...but I do expect it to work better than the 8-year-old HP ScanJet I used to have and sadly it doesn't.  The few pictures I tried gave me the impression the camera inside is fairly low resolution and its picture-taking is augmented by a cheap, harsh LED flash (you can see it at the border of the frame in the form of a bright hotspot).

The VuPoint website is dirt-simple to use, but doesn't really do anything to alleviate your pain shy of offering a download of the dreadfully-written manual or a zipped up folder of drivers ""for Windows"".  I can't tell which version or how new they are.

Pressing a button to begin the scan doesn't launch any VuPoint software:  it opens the Scanner & Camera Wizard in Windows XP.  In short, it's not really giving you anything more than a conventional scanner, but it is giving you a whole lot less.

It's embarrassing. I have cheap Bic pens that look ugly but blow this fancy pen (with junk ink) away when it comes to the reason for using a pen -- to write :)

It sounds like many people are having issues with Cross ink these days. Kind of sad -- I have Cross pens that are 30 years old. Too bad Cross isn't as good with ink as they are with hardware. I'm looking for alternatives to this ink. I will post here if I find a better alternative.

------
10/11/12 Update: BIG news! I found an alternative. The refills from the uni-ball 207 Gel pens work for this Cross pen. They are far superior to the Cross refills. Why?
1) They fit. The Cross refills don't even fit so the tip doesn't go into the pen all the time. These uni-ball refills work perfectly.
2) No skipping (at least through 7 refills)
3) They use uni-ball's ""Super Ink"" which uni-ball touts as amazing because it ""is specially formulated to become trapped in paper, helping prevent criminal check washing and other document alteration"". I have no idea if it really works but it sounds impressive and I choose to believe them. I feel better when I use this ink when I sign my name on things.
4) You can buy a 10 pack of the uni-ball pens at Sam's for about the price of 3 or 4 Cross refills.

The only thing I don't like about the refills is that they don't last long but that seems to be the case with all gel ink (including the original ink in this Cross pen). I like gel ink so I choose to live with it.

--------------------
10/22/13 Update: The last batch of ""refills"" I got from a pack of uni-ball Gel pens was horrible. They have some sort of wax like nib on the tips that you have to remove before using. When you remove it, the pen leaks. I figured it was just one bad one out of the 10 pack, but alas, 5 of the 10 so far have been bad. The good news is that after awhile, the leak stops and the refill works. Does it seem like we're having to work too hard to use pens lately? Very sad. I'm not sure where that leaves those who want a refill for The Cross Edge Capless Gel Ink Pen. Maybe it was just a bad package of refills? I'm not going to spend my money again to find out. For now, I've quit using the Cross pen and am using Sharpie Pens. They don't leak and the medium/bold one is awesome. Very sad day when I trade an expensive Cross pen for a Sharpie.

I got it all set up again, but this time it took about an hour. I had to re-install the Windows 7 drivers and reestablish my wireless connection.

Once I could see the Brother printer on my wireless network, setting up my Macbook Pro and my other Windows 7 machine was a breeze. For the Mac, however, the CD provided a link to their website to download the driver for OS 10.9, other than that installation went just fine.

Without AC power, the phone barely functions. Yet, to be fair, in some vague way you can still say it functions. Without power - the lights for which line is in use don't work, the speaker phone does not work, and virtually every other function of this phone will not work. Yet to be extremely fair, you could make a phone call - just don't expect even a simple led to light up when you select which phone line you want to use or even to light up if the phone rings.

I have had a few Panasonic multi-line phones over the years and they all worked perfectly, even without a power adapter or batteries.

This phone also has a POOR interface: When I plugged this phone in - using the supplied AC adapter - I got a bright red light on line 2 saying a message was waiting. No such message existed and I could not figure out how to extinguish it. I don't think I should need to consult a manual or call customer support to use a basic two line phone!

The bottom line is this phone is a step backward from the traditional designs which are decades old. These older designs were powered by the phone lines themselves and had simple pushbuttons and lights. What used to be a simple press of a button to select line 1 or 2 is no longer so simple on this phone. You have lights and what appear to be corresponding push buttons on this phone yet sometimes they are not push buttons - just raised pieces of chromed plastic. A very confusing layout for what should be a simple device.

This phone is being shipped back to Amazon as I type this.

* People are constantly telling me that they can't hear me --- the microphone is way too quiet. The phone does not use a standard 1/8"" plug, so you can't easily replace the headset with one that will work better.

* The light that tells you which of the two lines the incoming call is on does not light constantly when a call comes in. (It's only on where there's actually a ringing sound, but not between rings), and you have to know which line is active before you can pick up (there are two switches, one for each line). So, you have to sit and stare at the phone for several seconds until the light comes on before you can answer. I usually guess wrong when I just pick one or the other of the lines. There's no ""pick up whichever line is ringing"" button.

* It's very difficult to determine the position of the volume control. Since the control wheel is on the side and is very smooth, you can't even tell if you're moving it when you run your finger over it.

* The phone does not go off hook automatically when you start dialing, so you have to remember to select a line, first.

* There's no caller ID, which is obvious from the picture. I thought that this lack wouldn't be a problem, but it turns out that I rely more on caller ID than I had thought.

In the manual, it does not mention about where to do all the print setting.  You have to set the tray to Photo tray (tray #1) every time before you can print a picture because it is set to use the tray #2 by default.  The rear feeder doesn't like to take photo paper.

The left side of this wrist pad has unexpectedly ripped open and is now oozing out white, sticky gel material.  The gel also continues to provide no resilience after removing wrists or elbows from it.
I remain surprised at how many good reviews exist for this product. Perhaps these people are not using the pad that much.
If you are a heavy laptop/keyboard user, then please beware of the issues relating to this product, as explained below!
In my opinion, this 3M product is JUNK, and I now have no other option but to throw it in the garbage and look for another product.
****

I was really hoping this would be the perfect ""set it and forget it"" product to help add extra comfort for the long hours at my desk.  It does not live up to the favorable reviews it's getting, and here's why I feel that way:

When I rest my wrists on the pad, or the underside of my forearms, I hit the ""bottom"" of the pad within minutes.  Meaning, the gel gives way and pushes aside to the point that when I poke the pad with my finger, I only feel the solid base that the gel sits on.  Am I pushing *that* hard to separate the gel to such an extent? I don't believe so! I consider my arm to be resting lightly upon it.

But this gel issue has become a growing comfort problem that does not lend itself to good ergonomics. I expected better support from a wrist pad produced by 3M, not something that would give way and leave my wrists resting on a vinyl covering with hard plastic underneath.  Also, if the gel gives way on the front/leading edge of the pad, then my forearm or wrists begin to feel the plastic corner digging in, which is practically as bad as resting on the bare desk itself.

The other issue I'm having is with the resilience of the gel. When I let the wrist pad sit for an hour after use, the original shape of the pad will restore itself slightly.  But in my few weeks of using this pad, I've found the deeper a depression my arm makes into the pad (from extended use), the longer it takes for the gel to return to its normal position.  In some cases, I have to force the gel by literally kneading it in the direction of the pad's depressed area so the gel can even out and begin filling in the gap that my arm made while it was resting there.

So overall, the length of the pad is decent. Enough for a laptop and mouse on the side.  But I hope my video can show you that while the product is very comfortable at first glance, it can quickly distract you and take your attention away from the work you're doing at your desk!",Consumer Alert: Please Read Before Buying!!,1412121600,15,

The results;
The first printing I did, the black ink smeared even several hours after. Then I remembered it said to print on 'glossy photographic' which I hadn't done so I did another page correctly that time. It worked! The black did NOT smear.
Then I wet my hands and picked up a bottle I had put a label on. I thought the label was going to come off as the smallest amount of water spread through the whole label. It didn't come off and eventually dried, still the ink didn't smear. However, the label separates if it gets wet. The top printed part separates from the sticky back part. The printed part curls away from the sticky backing.
UPDATE
It isn't the 'usual' shade of white, as per paper. Its slightly grey, very slightly but when put onto a white bottle it is noticeable, the color difference. Not only that but I'm a tad upset that it dosnt stick! Oh at first it does, but within a very short time, an hour, the labels become unstuck. That is no good to me.

They are nice and shiny and using the correct setting on my ink jet printer, the 'glossy photographic', they don't smear and the print looks lovely.

Second, the balance is terrible. If it's not leaning against a wall, it will fall over. (Even against a wall it might.) Too much top weight on too narrow a base, which is a basic engineering no-no.

Going from bad to worse. The printer is now officially almost a paperweight (well, I can use the scanner). The printer mangles the paper, and now I just received the ""print unable oa"" error I reported in May 2015, totally unusable for printing even mangled pages.

As I noted when I first got this printer in 2014, I was concerned about the quality as compared to other Brother printers I have owned. For a printer to break down to an unusable level when I have more than 20% of my original drum left is unacceptable. I strongly recommend avoiding this printer. Now I need to get a new laser color and not sure which one.

UPDATE APRIL 2016

I have had this printer since July 2014. Since then I have printed out about 17,000 pages, about 800 pages a month. I have probably scanned 10,000 to 15,000 pages. Unfortunately, although I have about 40% of my drum left, I am getting an indentation (sort of like a notary seal impression) on the page, and more frequent paper jams. The paper path is completely clear front and rear. Of course it is out of warranty, which is why I will now probably always buy one of these extended warranties for printers because it seems as if the quality of printers is going down these days. I had another brother printer which lasted much longer)

As you can see from my original review below, I did have concerns about the build quality, and now those concerns are showing up. I would definitely not recommend this printer unless you get a service plan that has in-house service. The printer is huge and probably weighs about 60 pounds, so it would be a big hassle to drag it to any service center.

I have liked brother products in the past, so I am not quite sure what I will do to replace this one.

Update January 2015:

I have just started using color printing of documents and I must say I am disappointed in the difference between what I see on the screen, or from what I have scanned, and what gets printed out. The most obvious discrepancy is scanning or copying a letter that is signed in blue ink, and the print out is much darker, sometimes almost with her purple tint. The same for printing emails that have their replies in blue: it prints out almost a dark purple. Since this is my first color printer I don't know how accurate they tend to be. The printed version is still okay and usable, but not as accurate as I would like it to be especially since each color cartridge costs about $90, a total of $270 just to replace the cartridges. I have used Brother printers for years, but this one is a disappointment.

Update December 2014:

As I note below, one of the primary things I use a multifunction printer for the scanning documents. I still have my older Brother 8860DN, and I have scanned tens of thousands of pages of documents. I have not used the new printer (L8850CDW) nearly as much, and recently, I have noticed more scanning jams. Recently I scanned a 35 page document in the new printer, but it kept jamming. I tried scanning it in my older Brother printer without a problem.

I have concerns this color printer will not be as reliable. Although it is heavier, it does not feel as well constructed. For example, the 8860DN has a very solid feel where the paper is fed, as well as in the part where you put in envelopes, when you open and close it. The L8850CDW feels much less solid, which is maybe why I am having problems.

This last scan, which works on my old Brother (8860DN), but not on my new Brother (L8850CDW) is a bad sign that the new Brother is not as well made and will not hold up over the long-term. Right now, I would not recommend this printer. I will update if further use changes my opinion.

Initial review:

I received this printer recently, and I will be updating this review as I use the printer more. So far I am the first verified purchaser to leave a review (the others were Vine reviewers). I had concerns about ordering because it is a brand new and untested new model and one of the two initial Vine reviewers reported some jams in printing double-sided. A printer should not be jamming regularly no matter unless you are feeding in the wrong kind of paper. The other reviewer didn't try the scanning function.

My first attempt at printing 50 pages double-sided worked perfectly.

I have also scanned double-sided with no problem. The bottom line, if this printer works as well as my other Brother printers, I will be very happy. I have been a long-time user of Brother printers and I have scanned many tens of thousands of pages with virtually no jamming. One of the reasons I switched from HP to Brother is that the HP printers I have used were always jamming. This is a feature that is too important to me and I can't afford to be dealing with paper jams of any kind.

I should note that although the sheet feeder is rated for 50 pages, as were my older Brother printers, I do not recommend doing that many at one time. Depending on the condition of what you are scanning, I would scan anywhere from 25 to 40 pages at a time, with 30 as average. Although it would be really nice to scan more pages (and I will attempt that with this printer over the next several days), I have not found that the particularly problematic and it virtually eliminates jams at least for the scanning part of the printer. (Update, I just scanned 43 pages in a batch without problem). (Second Update, scanned about 700 pages, mostly 40 to a batch, no problems, and even was able to scan 52 pages without a problem).

It was relatively easy to hook up the printer wirelessly although I thought the instructions were not perfectly clear and I did have a few glitches along the way. For example the instructions recommend using a USB cable to do the initial wireless connection but I still haven't found where the USB cable would actually go on the printer. I looked in the manual to see if there was a diagram showing where the USB connector is, but there is no such diagram. USB is not even listed in the index at the back of the manual. I was able to set it up wirelessly.

Fortunately the printer does scan wirelessly directly from the printer to your computer without using any cable. I am using Windows 8. I had been unable to scan wirelessly with my older brother printer when I upgraded to Windows 8, but so far this new printer works perfectly.

There is a place for putting a thumb drive and you can scan directly to the thumb drive which is a great feature. It appears to be USB 2.0 which is not so great, but I haven't done enough scanning to the thumb drive yet to see if that impacts the speed at which documents are scanned.since Since it scans so easily directly to my computer, I may not use the feature but certainly would be useful if you have a busy office and might want to give a scanned copy of something to someone, or scan something to take with you in a hurry. I believe it also lets you print from documents on the USB.

The print quality looks very good so far as does the scan quality.

The touch screen is nice but it is a little finicky when having to side scroll through options. It is easy to go one selection or two too far, but you probably won't have to use touch screen all that often. In addition, you can control all or most functions from your computer. However, I do think the touchscreen responsiveness needs to be improved a little bit.

The only problem I've had with other Brother printers is that sometimes for single-sided printing the paper curls significantly and I have to constantly monitor the printer to take out the pages otherwise they will get all mixed up. It is not a deal breaker for me but I will see if that happens with this printer and let you know. I just noticed that the settings have an option from the Control Center which is installed when you set up the computer, to reduce paper curl. I have turned that on and then I will update if I notice any difference in the amount of curling as I used the printer more. I have not done enough printing to say for sure, but so far, this has not been a problem.

It is very heavy and it is definitely a two-person job for initially getting the printer to wherever you want to be.

This is my first color printer and although I don't have a much need for color, I thought it was a nice feature. In my prior Brother printers I was able to bypass the early warning system for changing the toner. One reviewer seems to imply this may not be possible for this printer. If I can figure out how to do that with this printer I will let you know as well. For a black and white laser printer was simply putting a piece of tape over the sensor, but I am not yet sure if this is possible with this printer.

Overall I've been very happy with the Brother printers I've had in the past and I am keeping my fingers crossed that I will continue to be happy. I would probably give us a 4.5 stars if Amazon had that as an option(why don't they have that as an option?), primarily for the finicky touchscreen. For now I am going to read it 4 stars, but if it continues to work well over time and I am able to override sensors from Brother that force you to change the cartridges too often(unless I can find some explanation of why they do this that seems reasonable), then I will upgraded to five stars over time.

UPDATE 1: My first scanning glitch/concern: I had 15 pages to scan. Some of the pages had been stapled so of course I removed staples. I have done that for many hundreds of times if not more with my other Brother printers. What I usually do when there are pages that have been stapled is put the pages in upside down to minimize two pages sticking together. With my other brother printers  I rarely if ever had a problem. However, when I ran the 15 pages through (at 600 dpi color so it went relatively slowly), two of the pages did stick together. I decided to run the pages again, rather than just scan the missing page, and it happened a second time. I was very careful in putting the pages in and fanning them both times, so this is concerning. `

I ran the pages through a third time, this time in black and white I ran the pages through a third time, this time in black and white, same thing. I changed the order of the documents and ran it through a fourth time and it worked. That is not acceptable to me. I will do some more tests over the next few days and if necessary call Brother. If I do have to return this printer is going to be a hassle because it is so heavy.

Update 2: Well, I scanned 29 somewhat dog-eared pages (recipes) without a hitch, so that is increasing my confidence a bit, so I am going back to 4 stars. I hope to do a fair amount of scanning this week, so I will have a better idea if this is going to be a problem or not.

Update 3: did a larger scanning job of single sided, with no problem.

Update 4: So far, after about two months, no problems. My daughter was able to use the printer on her Mac (I have a PC).

Update 5: Update May 2015:

Though I have not used the printer much, out of the blue I received a ""print unable oa""  error message. The panel asks me to turn the computer off and  then back on. I did so, but the same error appears. Tech support is closed now, but I have a big print job needed for tomorrow. I will upgrade my rating back to its current 2 star if there is a simple fix for this, but, if not, my earlier concerns regarding build quality may prove true. ... a few days later,  unplugged the printer, left it off for a while, turned it back on, and the error message disappeared (see below). I decided not to turn off the printer until I had a chance to call Brother, but the more I use this printer, the less confidence I have that it will perform or last as long as other Brother printers I have had. Because of my concern regarding its reliability, I am actually going to buy a backup printer. In other words, if you need a printer for time sensitive business needs, I would be somewhat cautious in buying this particular printer.

Even without this problem, I think the printer is only fair, since the color is inaccurate, and the sheet feeder does not work reliably, but to get a sudden error message that disables the printer from working...that's a problem.","After printing 19,500 pages in two years, totally unusable, even with 22% of the original drum remaining.

It's bigger than it appears to be in pictures, the oval key-pad buttons are quite large (bigger than a nickel, smaller than a quarter), and the snap-on base for desk-top use holds the base at about a 45-degree angle for easy viewing of the LCD display and dialing (but this also makes the telephone appear to take up far more space on a desk than it actually does, and obscures the area immediately behind the telephone.)

Pro's:
- easy to program;
- very clear, crisp sound on both speaker and hand-set;
- very clear, well back-lit and easy-to-read LCD display.

Con's:
- no Caller-ID light to indicate calls received;
- in-coming calls fail to display in ""New Calls"" (the default LCD display) and only display in ""Call History"", meaning I have to open menu, then call history, and then each specific line number to see if I've missed any calls.

I'm pleased with most aspects of this telephone, but the jury is still out on the Caller-ID issue and hence whether or not it will be returned.

******

Update April 26, 2014:  After 15 months of home use, the LCD screen on this telephone is starting to degrade, losing thread-like horizontal lines of display (as has happened on every other AT&T phone with an LCD display I've purchased in the past few years.)  If it follows the pattern of my other AT&T phones, within months the LCD display will degrade to the point it will become unreadable.  For that reason I'm lowering my four-star rating to two stars, and I would not recommend this telephone.

*******

Update May 19, 2014:  I was overly optimistic about how fast the LCD screen would degrade; in little more than three weeks since my previous update, the LCD screen has degraded to the point that two out of the three lines displayed are almost unreadable.

I did that, but the Lide 25 scanner wasn't one of the ones listed!  Now that's just dumb on Canon's part.  So then I searched Canon's website for Vista compatibility for this scanner, and after awhile I found the Vista drivers and software for this specific scanner, and started downloading the ones shown.  Beware though--even though you have to specify the scanner model and OS in dropdown menus, they include OS/X software in the list, and it's not made apparent until you click on them which ones you're about to download.

So I downloaded the correct drivers and software in the list and installed them, but there were two other Vista-compatible software programs I still needed, ScanSoft OmniPage SE OCR and ArcSoft PhotoStudio.  So I went to the ScanSoft website and downloaded a Vista-compatible version, but when I checked ArcSoft's website, I couldn't find a way to download PhotoStudio without paying $80, $30 more than I did for my scanner!  Checking the Canon website again, it said that PhotoStudio wasn't compatible with Vista, so I was out of luck, since I primarily intended to use the scanner for photos.

There remains only one thing to do--get an RMA and send this hunk of junk back to Amazon.com.  While it may have been my fault that I didn't read the technical details to find out which versions of Windows this scanner was and was not compatible with, everywhere else it says that it is compatible with Windows.  Well, Vista IS windows, and it's been out for nearly two years as of 10/08.

Update:  I've since replaced the Lide 25 scanner with a Canon CanoScan 8800, and I couldn't be more pleased.  It works great with Vista, and comes standard with both OCR software and Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.  The scanner also has a lighted top cover to better scan negatives and slides, & includes three different negative/slide holders.  It was worth buying it to get Photoshop Elements 5 alone.  Forget the Lide 25--go with the CanoScan 8800 and you won't regret it.",Royal pain to get working in Vista,1223856000,2,

The main reason I wanted to update was to have more call blocking. My old phone could block 20. This was the third model I've tried since deciding to update. The first one made a weird sound while using the speaker on any handset, and it was also in the KX-TGE line. It was an issue with the phone, not anything else. What I loved about it was that it could block entire ranges of phone numbers, and my telemarketer calls all but stopped. I couldn't live with the speaker issue, so I exchanged that model for a different one, not realizing it could block only single entries, and not ranges. The telemarketer calls started up almost immediately. After about 10 days, I spent almost 2 hours researching Panasonic's different models. While I like their quality, they have SO many models, it's just ridiculous. I wanted one of the newest models, and even the Panasonic website won't tell you which models are the latest and greatest. (They ""say"" they're showing you the newest, but that's not the case.) The various phone descriptions will say call blocking is included, but you have to actually go to the user manual to find out whether you can block ranges of numbers.

Even after all my research, this phone had the same mysterious sound issue when using the speakerphones. Back to more research. I did online chat with Panasonic to *try* to find the absolute newest cordless phone they had. The person on the other end could not have been more clueless. I knew more about their products than she did. Next I called their 800-number and asked the same question. This person was even more clueless. She transferred me to a salesperson. When I asked her which models could block ranges of numbers instead of individual numbers, she kept repeating, ""but all of our phones have a blocking feature."" That's not what I asked, and I told her that blocking ranges of numbers was a feature on some of their phones and that she should know that. I was never able to make this person understand the difference between blocking ranges of numbers and blocking individual numbers, so I hung up.

After more research on various websites, I discovered the Panasonic KX-TGE234B. I've been using it for almost 4 days, and so far, it's perfect. It's a major update from previous models.",The KX-TGE Line Has Issues,1413590400,108,

They claim that it is (Canon) compatible with chrome books, however, that is my amazon friends, is a lie. A straight up LIE.

To it's credit, I had no problem setting up the printer for my macbook, however it was purchased for our small business, and we use different types of computers/tablets. After the ease of connecting it to my mac (and printing from my iPhone), my love affair with this printer abruptly ended. I don't know who designed this but it is not at all user friendly after that point. You have to jump through a series of hoops to connect it to google cloud---printing special codes, scanning upc symbols, unlocking and locking your router, then resetting it...changing the wireless settings on the printer, then making a special google cloud printing account. GEEZ! This is not even counting all of the different instructions that I had to find just to do those things.. the google searches and canon searches that I had to perform, and the by sheer luck, I finally got it to print.  FOR THE DAY.

After that, we had to start most of that process all over again, shutting down the printer and the router, and the computer. Crossing our fingers and doing a special dance..its crazy.  In the end, a product that was supposed to make our new business run smoother ended up causing the most issues. Only one person can print. That is crazy. Also, because this printer cleans its printer heads EVERY TIME YOU PRINT, we are now out of ink after 30 days. I know its been that long, because I tried to return this. But, unfortunately, after purchasing I had to traveling, then had a medical issue, and by the time that I returned to work my frame to return this thing had expired. Too bad for me, but maybe not for you dear reader, because you can have it. Please, take it off my hands. Really. You pay for shipping. It sickens me just to look at it.

You may think that I am being a bit dramatic, and of course I am, but not quite by that much. I assumed that this was simply our fate. To hope that the printer would work, and to be grateful that at least I could print from my mac. Then, we received a different printer, the HP Photosmart 6520e-All In One Series, and let me tell you, I DREADED to open the box and hook it up. I was certain that what lay ahead was a least a frustrating 2 hours of my time (if i was lucky). But no, dear reader, it was 3 minutes. That is it,  3 measly minutes. All done. Everyone prints. No problemo. That is when I knew for certain, that we were being fooled.
RUN AWAY dear readers. RUN Away. If the hp printer can recognize everything that quickly ( i didn't even need the cd, it just downloaded its drivers and updates from the web, and it automatically recognized my wifi, no special codes!) AND it worked for the chrome book (without advertising it, I might add), there is a serious problem with Canon. It made me really begin to wonder why they advertised which platforms their printers work with anyway...shouldn't they work with them all?  Yes. The answer is yes. If you made it this far to the end of this very long review, and you still want this printer, then let me gift it to you.

These bags look gray in the picture but are actually white. The color is not the relevant part, I am more concerned about it being a different product than advertised. I purchased these same bags from ebay (was in urgent need of them so chose to use Amazon prime this time) and the bags from ebay were great. They were thick and durable, when I attempted to distress one to test the durability, it was still in perfectly good shape for shipping which I found impressive. Anyway, I'm not advertising for ebay, it was a private seller anyway, but they looked EXACTLY the same as shown in the Amazon picture.

So it arrived in one day which I was pretty pleased about because I like having them stocked up for online selling. They came in a GIANT box! It was big enough for me to forgot what I ordered. Like these could have been mailed in such a small box. They were actually folded in a plastic bag so they woulda probably shipped fine in a poly mailer!!! So aside from the waste of packaging (I guess that's the seller's or Amazon's choice to waste packaging...awesome). Anyhow I used sizzors, as usual, to cut the tape on the box. The bags were underneath those padded air packs so there's no way the sizzors could have punctured them. I took the bags out and was so irritated and disappointed. The first thing I noticed was one of the bags were out of the group of folded bags, and the bag had to puncture holes at the bottom!!! The holes went all the way through the bag. I removed the punctured bag and realized it was stuck to the others because the sealing tape was partially ""unstuck"" already. Upon ripping that bag from the others, I realized these were white, paper thin bags an there's no way I would trust sending anything to customers across the country in these! Not even a lightweight article of clothing.

The claims are opposite of what I saw in these bags so I'm not going to say ""well you get what you pay for"" because this was false advertising- NOT just a gamble I decided to take.

So disappointed hopefully I can send them back and have time to do so and order more.

I would have been more than willing to pay more for better quality, but it was the false claims of what a durable poly mailer should be, that prompted me to take advantage of this deal.

Edelen,"After my local phone company crosswired the DC on my phone line and fried the phones in my home, I had to replace the stalwart GEs that I had had for years, speakerphones that just plain worked. I checked reviews and decided the AT&T CL2909 was a good option for one of the phones I needed to replace.

Boy, are some of the reviews of this phone WAAAAY off. This thing is an engineering catastrophe.

Every function on this phone, save for the basic function of actually dialing a number and talking with another human over the handset, WILL NOT WORK unless four AA batteries are installed! Considering that all landline phones draw DC power by default, how is it possible that this phone can't tap any advanced functions without batteries installed? My old speakerphone used one AA to keep numbers in memory alive should there be a power failure, yet even the speakerphone function on this AT&T will not work unless all four batteries are installed. Here's the FAIL list if the user does not install batteries:

Memory backup
Caller ID
Menu functions
Mute
LCD display
Speakerphone
Clock
Directory
Hold
Redial
Flash
CALL INFO light

That's a joke. Worse, the box veils the truth by playing up that this phone does not need AC to run. Well, neither did my old GE speakerphone, as only one of its functions depended on batteries, not most all of them. An addendum inside the AT&T box tells the sad truth about what leaving the batteries out means. And yes, I removed the batteries as a test, and this phone's advertised strengths vanish. The manual doesn't even get this lack right, insisting the display works without batteries when the handset is lifted. Again, tests reveal this to be wrong also.

Obviously, battery consumption will be huge with this phone. That's a joke, too.

This is supposed to be a desktop/wall-mountable unit. But hanging it on a standard wall mount reveals two maddening problems: The backing plastic is thin and doesn't make for a tight connection, so the phone wobbles on the wall mount, plus the LCD display angle shifts so badly it becomes unreadable, no matter the lighting. No amount of contrast adjustment fixes that LCD-readability problem, either. (The Amazon.com picture of this phone implies it has a helpful greenish backlighting, but no backlighting exists. No doubt AT&T supplied the image.)

Do I even need to talk about the clipping when the speakerphone volume is raised? Should I mention the clicking heard by people on hold?

If this phone had been released in 1980, some of these problems could be excused. But for this phone to be so much worse than a phone I purchased 10 years ago is reprehensible engineering. It doesn't matter what the cost, I'd pay twice as much for this phone if it matched what my old GE could do. That it claims to and yet fails so miserably is frustrating to the nth degree.

I've reviewed a couple hundred products here on Amazon.com, and I've got to believe that only the sonic mosquito deterrents are worse products than this utter piece of techno-rubbish. It's as if AT&T never asked a human being to use this phone so as to get actual product feedback. That so many purchasers of this phone on Amazon gave it good reviews is baffling when it fails on such simple levels.",Total engineering FAIL,1287792000,115,

I bought it about 8 months ago and at first I thought it did a great job. HP came with a cartridge and I was surprised to find out that my epson did not. But I had read so many positive things about it that I overlooked this little clue about the primary function of this machine.
My machine would not print after three weeks. It would not print in black because the magenta was empty. Which was odd because I only printed in black. However, the tech at staples told me you always use color even in black print. But the magenta would empty before the black? Doesnt make sense. Ok. I installed the magenta and the machine printed for one day. Then, the yellow was empty. I had to replace all the cartridges before the month was up. The second set of cartridges were replaced within one week. I returned to staples and they replaced the cartridges as we thought the cartridges were defective. But no, the machine would run out of one color or another within a few weeks consistently. Then, I realized, this machine is meant to keep you spending money all year round. the set of cartridges are over 50$. After struggling for months with this stupid printer, I just went out and bought an HP about four months ago. I am still using the cartridges it came with and have not run out of ink.

Lexmark's and HP's have been way too expensive on ink. The Lexmarks also had inferior print quality and reliability problems to boot. I have run almost a million pages through several printers. I lost my ip3000 in a power outage. I suspect that this triggered a circuit which could be reset or replaced. Tech support was useless. My failing eyesight has prevented me from being able to completely disassemble the old printer. The internal power supply does supply power to the printer, but nothing else works. If someone out there knows how to fix this problem let me know. I still have about 20 cartridges for this printer. I would love to have it working again.

For the new ip4700,I was disappointed by the tiny ink cartridges. I also prefer transparent ink tanks. This printer takes much longer to start printing than my precious printers. This is the slowest printer I have used in years. It took several minutes to print 4 pages of text with colored borders, then crashed my computer. It printed on reboot. On a good day even 1 page of text takes several seconds. Also, the default paper source is automatic which looks for the lower tray first and if it is empty it locks up the computer rather than looking at the rear tray which is my preferred paper source as I can see the type of paper being loaded. ADDITIONAL WARNING Do not use the driver CD: download the driver, although that is still giving my computer(WINXP) problems even after 2 driver upgrades. The print quality is no better than my old s450 and ip3000, which were good. I do not normally print photos, but advertising material. I am probably going to return this printer. I am so glad I bought it through Amazon.
Update: I have not returned the printer. I needed one. This printer still hangs up after a print job. I have to cancel it manually and that takes several minutes to execute. To print several jobs could take 1/2 hour. I now have found a used ip4500 (more ink for less) and I will sell this ip4700 printer cheap.

Next update -1 month later. Still major problems - Finished print jobs will not release printer. It takes typically 1/2 hour to print 4 multiple page jobs in standard res. Constant cleaning cycles caused it to run the magenta and cyan out of ink after 2 pages color and 50 pages of text. Many non-OEM cartridges do not work properly with this printer causing lockups. I do not recommend this printer for anyone.

It is now 3 months and a move later. I purchased a used Canon after my experiences with this one. I probably will not buy another new Canon. This one freezes, then will not release the print jobs and prevents any more printing without a reboot. It uses more ink in setting itself than I used in actual printing. One set of cartridges did not even last 100 pages of text and a few pictures. I do not think the non_OEM cartridges are as much a problem as is the software. I am going to purchasing a cheap laser printer for my text jobs.","Not as good as previous models, in fact very poor",1279843200,2,

For a pen 2x the cost of the Metropolitan, why does the customer have to start by cleaning it?  Anyhow, I washed, soaked, and dried it out.  I tried a converter filled with the Waterman black but it still ran dry on all papers unless I pressed very hard and wrote very slowly.  Why buy a fountain pen if I have to do that?  Next I tried the always wonderful Kon-Peki ink.  Still slow, dry, and scratchy.

The printer says that it is Offline 90% of the time (it occasionally decides to wake up and print, but I never know why). It SAYS it is online (I only have the option when I right-click to ""Use the Printer Offline"", not Online, so it THINKS it is online). Their next advice says:
""Right click on the icon for your Brother machine => See what's printing => Printer => Pause Printing (Take the checkmark off.)""
Except I don't have a checkmark. So it tells me to log in as an administrator. Then my only options are to Pause the printing. And there are no further suggestions.

I read in the other reviews that this lack of 'Ready' status might be due to an unstable wireless connection. SO I bought a USB cord and connected it that way. It STILL won't go to Ready.

Now my old shredder was just a no-name, 8 sheet shredder bought about 5 years ago on sale for $25.00 It served me well until now, and I pushed it well past what it was rated at. I started doing my research, and of course came straight to Amazon. I decided on this shredder based on the reviews, and received it as a Christmas present, and gave the old one to my son, who didn't have one yet.

Well, it looks like I should have given him the new one, and kept the old one! We started cleaning up our basement, and of course there was a large amount of old papers that were now old enough to be shredded. I brought them up and got to work. It didn't take long to realize that this wasn't any better than my old ""cheapie"" one, and couldn't last near as long at a time. My old shredder could work 3-4 times longer, and this one started getting warm quickly, so I couldn't shred more than a couple of minutes before stopping. It will shred 11 sheets, but so could my old one, even though it wasn't rated for it. I was only on my second bin full when it jammed up badly, stopping the machine, just on a credit card. Reversing it then jammed the card under the switch that starts the shredder,really making things fun! I had to dig it out using a letter opener, finally getting it working again.

I have only done 4 bins full, but that is enough to let me know that this is a VERY lightweight machine. For the money, I believe you would be just as well served with the AmazonBasics 8 sheet shredder, which is only $30, or the 12 sheet for $50. I am very disapointed in the quality of this Fellowes shredder, and couldn't recommend it to anyone. Based on my admitedly limited experience with it, I don't feel it will last all that long, and I will be trying a different brand when it bites the dust. (maybe GoECOlife ?) I still have a lot of papers to shred, and will update this review when I'm done.

*****UPDATE: I have now done 8 large trash bags full, and this shredder is about done for. The more I shredded the quicker it went downhill. It was oiled consistant with Fellowes specs, and got louder and louder. It will also only handle about 5 pages comfortably now. The 'no-name"" one I had before will last much longer than this one will. The weakest point is definately the motor- it overheats quickly. The cutters are the only decent quality part on this thing, even the switches are junky.
My advice: this is only good enough for VERY light use, and for that purpose, you can get the 8 page AmazonBasics shredder for less than half. When this thing goes belly up, (which will be soon) I will be trying a different brand. For the money this should have been much better.
I tried TWICE to contact Fellowes about this shredder, and they did not respond either time. I also left a review on their website very much like this one and they refused to post it. This shows me that they are aware, but completely unconcerned about the lack of quality of this product, and I for one, have bought my last product of any type from them.","Not as good as expected, Lightweight motor, Will not last.",1326844800,8,

I wished I could keep using my Epson R2400, but it really wastes more ink now than ever because of the cleaning cycles. It still prints great when it wants to, but has been leaving ink debris between swaps because ink gunk gets caught in the machine from somewhere causing dirty prints. Not all the time. I've printed with this machine since it came into the market. So many many years and thousands of prints. So this R3000 I know I'll probably have a love or hate relationship because of the R2400. I hate wasting money on ink and on new printers even though the quality is outstanding.

So after a year of doing some heavy duty printing from letter size (8.5""x""11) to 13""x19"" and many double-sided prints on almost exclusively on matte paper (Ultrasmooth or something equivalent) I am really very disappointed with this Epson printer. The quality is slightly better than that of my previous model. I don't use the highest setting so I can't speak about that, but I do print from fast prints to medium speed and quality printing. I'm happy with the results. What I'm not happy with is the constant clogging this machine seems to do all the time. I print every week and sometimes 3-4 times per week. I never let more than a few days pass, but sometimes if more than a few days do pass without printing the machine comes back and tells you it's clogged by running the print quality test on the utility program. I have never had to run so many cleaning cycles on the older Epson model as much as this behemoth of ink wastefulness. My old machine could be okay even if a month passes by. This machine gets the printer heads clogged every week and I have to normally run from 1-3 cleaning cycles which results in at least $5 each time from what I've read around, but that's on any good week. Every couple of months or so one of the heads is completely clogged even though it may have not been initially clogged a few minutes ago when printing something. It almost starts feeling a bit fishy. I know Epson has been accused of tampering with their inks, but I can't say this for sure. So twice in a year I had to run between 8-13 cleaning cycles because the printing heads are clogged to the point the printer tests show up blank on any given color ink cartridge while 6 or 7 of them are completely fine. The first time this happened it was the Black and Cyan colors and this last time (today) it was the Vivid Magenta (not sure why we need to keep saying Vivid all the time). So I had to spend most of the afternoon doing print tests and running long printing cycles. Eventually almost giving up. I'm one step in the direction of selling this thing on ebay. I am so disappointed. I hope the clogging doesn't continue. I'm thinking of trying another brand after more than 15 years using only Epson products and even after they aren't working so well I have been a firm supporter. Scanners and printers. Canon might be my next choice.

Update 10-23-2016
So twice this year I've received faulty ink cartridges of Epson brand. You will have to call them to get it replaced after some bogus diagnosis you have to perform (taking all the ink cartridges out and waking 15 minutes and reinserting). I call this ""the dance"" and then you get your replacement. If you happen to be an artist you can instead of chuck the cartridge away, you can use to to do some ink washes. Be sure to use gloves. You will have to open up the full cartridge and empty the ink into a bottle or equivalent. It dries tacky on slick surfaces, but you can always spray fixative on it and better yet it's archival. I figure it needs to be heated to be waterproof so it's not. This of course will be the most expensive ink you will buy in your life, but better to use it for something.",Replacing my R2400 with the R3000 and I am very very disappointed with the expensive inks and constant clogging.,1415923200,6,

I was totally stoked to find these pens. Paper Mate is not at the pinnacle of fine pens but they have some decent products. (Just like BIC, Pilot, Zebra, etc and other brands in the same category.) As an artist who quickly tires of the blue and black basic choices, finding a selection of colors in a ballpoint pen was awesome! Too bad these pens didn't live up to my own expectations, nor the hype released by Paper Mate.

My biggest complaint is that the pens leak little ""ink balls"" where ever you write. Ok, let's just say it: they poop. No matter that pen poops are one of the most annoying issues a pen can have, some pens do this occasionally. Some do it when they are new. InkJoy does it ALL THE TIME. It's frustrating and messy. I'm not quite sure how a left handed person could write with these - I would assume their arm would drag through the ink and make an enormous mess on the paper and on their arm. Everything I've written with these pens has gone into the trash. I enjoy writing letters by hand - but these pens totally took away that joy. My excitement at finding this ""new and exciting"" product turned to frustration and irritation as soon as I put pen to paper.

I don't expect low cost pens to perform miracles. I anticipate differences between Paper Mate and Montblanc. I also enjoy using cheaper pens and have an enormous slew of pens from all manufacturers, at just about every price point imaginable. However, I will NOT buy these again. There are so many other pens available - pens in fabulous colors, at varying prices, in an array of tips, with fantastically smooth ink - I question why someone would even bother with these. I usually keep the pens I'm not thrilled with - you never know. Tastes change, sometimes a pen you don't like at first winds up being your favorite pen down the road. That said, these went directly in the trash. I didn't stick them with the other pens. No, I did not want these to ""corrupt"" the rest of my pens. (haha) I knew these were some of the worst pends I'd dealt with and my mind would not change about that. Don't waste your money...just move onto the next assortment of colored pens.

The main reason for this HP choice was it will take heavier weight paper for the cards she makes and it was reasonably priced. I currently have two HP printers for our everyday uses so HP was a given choice for my Mom. I seem to be having all of the same odd issues that most of the one star ratings have. Set up was a bit of a pain. My business printer which is a Canon Pixma Pro 100 was a set up breeze. This HP was pain...not a huge one but it was not as easy as I thought it should be and the instructions were not very clear on the steps. Once installed the darn thing wouldn't print but I did remember someone saying that they had to turn off their printer in order to make it work. So I turned it off, turned it one and I could finally make a copy. Then I wanted to print something to show my Mom how to use it and it would not print. So off it went again, back on and then I was able to show her how to print. Now, while it did print the lag time from sending the print command to the printer actually printing was way too long, 45 seconds long to be exact. So the pages per minute the printer will print doesn't count the time and frustration of wondering if the printer got the command.  Okay, on to show my Mom how to scan...can you guess? It will not scan and it will not scan even if I shut if off and turn it back on. Now I have seen an HP response giving someone a web address which may help them trouble shoot their issue. By now I'm an hour into setting up a printer that should have taken about 5 minutes and I was too frustrated to spend any more time on hunting down what could be wrong with a brand new printer. My instructions to my Mom when I left were, if it won't do what you want it to, turn it off and then try again. You can't scan until I can find some time to hunt down what the problem is. And worst of all, I'm sorry for the lousy birthday present.
I've noticed HP responding to some of the comments so here's mine to HP:  I shouldn't have to hunt down anything to find out what the issue is with the scan function and I shouldn't have to turn the printer off and back on to make a function work.

I have these in every room that I use my computer. They are great looking, stable, easy to move and scoot nicely under sofa or furniture to get close to you. Easy to set up and adjust. Glass is an issue with some mouse sensors - but a paper underneath solves that.  I've tried lots of other styles and this is my favorite.

Update - May 2014:  The glass top on one of my carts just fell off one day when I set a coffee cup on one side.  Apparently the glue or whatever they use to hold the glass stopped holding and I'm not sure what to do.  I tried calling the manufacturer's warranty telephone numbers and it is always busy.  I tried emailing using their form on their website and no response.  I tried calling the corporate offices of Calico Designs and ended up leaving multiple messages for various people and never received a call back.

The cart sits in my own office and is just used for organizing - not heavily used other than occasional use for my laptop. So it wan't abused ir overused.

So - although I still love my stands that actually have glass on them... be warned that the glass may suddenly become unattached.  I was hoping I would get a response from the manufacturer that would resolve the  problem - I don't have the original documentation, but it looks like most of their products carry a 10 year warrantee, which is pretty worthless if they don't respond.
I'm going to try and use glass-only crazy glue that is activated by UV light and see if that works...  if not, I'll still have a nice base with no top.

When I saw some of the negative reviews, I glanced over and then dismissed them, figuring they were just the exception based on a purchaser getting a lemon or folks that didn't understand the technology very well.  The minority seems to have it right in this case.

PROBLEM:
The primary problem was an issue with the sound of my voice cutting in and out when I was on a call (your voice is fed back through the handset speaker normally). Many people may not realize that phones normally feedback your voice into the ear speaker until it ceases to work properly (as with these phones).  When it happened, my first reaction was that the line had dropped and I would start saying ""are you there, are you there?"".  When the other person invariably said ""yes"", I began to realize it was the phone malfunctioning.  Another problem is static on the phone occurring randomly on calls.  We've never had that problem until these new phones were put in.

I am returning the phones because of these two issues.  However, there are some pretty glaring design issues I'd also like to draw your attention to.

DESIGN DISAPPOINTMENTS (design points that make me wonder, with lots of frustration, what Panasonic engineers were thinking):
-- Unlit keypad (I knew about this from other reviews, but seriously, previous Panasonic phones had lit keyboards, what genius decides to go backwards on a key feature like this)
-- Non-dedicated key for voicemail (yes, this phone has an answering machine, but I can't buy a non-answering machine phone anymore, thank you Panasonic... they could at least recognize that a fair amount of people will use voicemail and design with that in mind, their previous phones had that)
-- Cheap feel to the phone itself (felt and looked like a cheap plastic kids toy)
-- Clunky menus.  The menus on the handset were not natural to flow through.  It is not that hard to take the time to make use and flow of menus an easy and non-confusing thing.  These felt like an after-thought.

The sad thing?  I am going to stay with Panasonic since they still have the best quality phone in my mind, it just happens to be a phone they no longer produce and sell, the KX-TGA520M series phone.  Looks like I'll be shopping eBay and Amazon marketplace.

Initially, this drum eliminated my printer's ""drum errors"" but within a few weeks I began to get ""drum error"" notices again and paper jams.  The Brother brand replacement drums are expensive but they have lasted at least six times as long as this one did, making this drum NO BARGAIN in the long run.

When I phoned Panasonic tech support,  try #1 was a 20 minute wait on hold then cut off with a busy signal, try #2 was a 20 minute hold followed by a transfer to a support person who spoke minimal English very quickly followed by another cutoff with busy signal (this after I asked her to speak slowly and clearly), and try #3 was an operator who, again, cut me off with a busy signal after I attempted to explain try #1 and #2.  I don't need to spell out what I think of this behavior.  Having no time for try #4, I have sent email (24-48 hrs to respond) but otherwise have no alternatives (repair center search yields a location in TX with the same phone number).  Meanwhile, I have a defective handset under warranty.  It was purchased at Staples, which has a short return period.

Except for the inconsistent quality and miserable service, I would have rated this as 4 stars (call destinations complain of not being able to hear clearly, especially on speakerphone, and it seems prone to interference--buzzing or fuzziness not associated with the line).  I really enjoy the bluetooth connection when it functions well (most of the time) and the wide range.  The answering machine is OK, but there is no way I have found to save messages as new or simply skip them.  Instructions are fairly good but there is no index and the TOC is not detailed.  I have not succeeded in downloading my contact information from my computer (Mac OS) to the phone.  Design is nice--light, unobtrusive, easy to carry--and the extra chargers are great.

1.0,False,"02 20, 2014",A3S9DOTT4Z8JF9,B00AAHMESY,,Amozarte,"HP have decided that they want to kill the laser printer by improving inkjet technology and, for the most part, they've succeeded with the HP Pro X451dn Color Printer.  This printer's few minor annoyances can easily be forgiven in light of the significant cost savings it brings to the table.

The X451dn takes a while to set up, and you may need two people if you're not into dead-lifting 38 pounds, but the process is not complicated.  A clear set of follow-the-bouncing-ball instructions will have you up and running in 45-60 minutes.  Initial setup is the only thing about this printer that is slow, though.  Both time-to-first-print and pages-per-minute blow away anything I've seen before.  As fast as it spits out paper, you'll wonder if the machine actually put anything on the page.

As fast as you'll burn through paper you'd think an inkjet printer would also burn through ink, but not so with HP's new inkjet technology.  After 3+ months of typical home printing I haven't noticed any appreciable drop in the ink levels.  When I first looked at the ink cartridge prices I almost had a heart attack because they're about the same price as an average laser toner.  However, these ink carts produce about five times as many prints as my old laser eked out on a high capacity toner.  And did I mention that there's no messy toner to spill?  Print quality is on par with what you may have come to expect from inkjet printers.  It did a satisfactory job for any business document I could throw at it, but it won't replace a photo printer any time soon.

My biggest complaint about this gadget is that ""wireless"" doesn't mean wireless networking.  The bad news is that you will still need an ethernet cable to connect the printer to your network, but the good news is that you can print directly from your phone or tablet.  The printer coughed up pages from my iPhone and iPad without any special software or fiddling.  It was a convenient experience worthy of an Apple device.  My other gripes involve the fact that this model is priced to beat entry-level colour lasers, but doesn't include the ""All-in-One"" features you might find in the slightly more expensive machines.  The X451dn is also just as big, heavy, and loud as any laser printer I've ever owned.  You won't want to put this thing in the family room or a bedroom because it has a nasty habit of waking up and clanking away for no reason at 2am.

Teeny tiny little annoyances aside, HP have really impressed with the reinvention of the inkjet.  Assuming you don't have extraordinary needs or expectations, both you and your wallet will be satisfied with this printer.

Pros and Cons Summary
+Super fast
+Long ink life
+Cheaper than laser
+No toner mess
+Easy to swap ink cartridges

-Lengthy initial setup
-""Wireless"" means printing from phones/tablets, not true wireless networking
-Print quality is good enough for business docs, but not photos
-No ""all-in-one"" features
-As big, heavy, and noisy as any laser printer

Note: If you need an all-in-one, consider the Brother Colour Laser MFC9330CDW, which usually sells for about ~$50-75 more than the HP X451dn, depending on the day.

***UPDATE as of November 2014***

About 355 days into owning this printer, it quit working and began to display an error code persistently.  No amount of button-pressing, resetting, unplugging, or other troubleshooting made any difference.  A little internet sleuthing uncovered that this model had a run of units with a manufacturing defect that caused the print bar to fail after around 2,000 pages.  Thank heavens I was still within the warranty period- just barely!

However, when I submitted the unit for service it came back as out of warranty- based on the manufacture date, which was naturally several months prior to the date of purchase.  HP requested that I provide copies of the receipt to show when I obtained the machine, which I happily submitted.  That was the last I heard from HP.  From then on I got auto-responses and nothing more.  After a month of being ignored, I finally tossed the defective unit.  (Well, I took it to Best Buy to be recycled for free.)

Manufacturing errors happen, and a small percentage of all tech hardware turns out to be defective.  It's a fact of life, and that's what warranties are for.  But ignoring support requests and not honouring the warranty is a great way to drive customers to the competition.  I used to be a computer consultant and sold a lot of HP printers, plotters, servers, and more.  For the last two decades I have bought nothing but HP printers for myself, and have recommended HP printers to family and friends more times than I can remember.  This experience changed all of that.  Today I bought a Brother.","Died after less than 2,000 pages",1392854400,17,

I spent two weeks and multiple calls to Amazon, HP, Brother, and Xfinity to try to figure out why the printer will not connect to our Xfinity wireless and why the computers cannot see and install the printer. We even had a second one sent from Amazon to replace the first to be sure its not a problem with this individual printer. Every service we tries to access punted the problem to the other services, Brother said it was an HP problem, HP said it was an Xfinity problem, Xfinity said it was a Brother problem. We went round and round, we finally got it working on a regular basis by connected a network cable to the printer, making it available to all computers. But even after this I have still had to reinstall the driver every day or so because the print goes into deep sleep which we cannot wake it. Only reinstalling the driver works. I am so disappointed with this printer, It does not connect wirelessly and Brother techs do not know what they are doing. One tech said it will not connect to the 5G network, An HP tech figured out that the two wireless networks we have confuses the Brother printer. But even so we could not get the Printer to be recognized by any of our four computers in the house on the 2.4 G wireless.

I 3D printed a rectangular base with an angled top to mount a small solar panel on. I designed the base precisely so I can cut two identical length strips of this tape and install it to the unit with two uniform inches of gorilla tape side by side.

After pressing the tape onto the 3D printed base I prepped the wall to which it was to be mounted on. Outdoors on a cinderblock wall. This proved to be no problem to the competitor brand 3M as I had previously used. Although I removed the 3M tape so I could install my custom made 3D printed angle bases for the solar panels with this ""superior, 30lb hold"" gorilla glue. I used about double the amount of Gorilla Mounting Tape than I did initially with 3M before using the 3D printed adapter. In addition to that, the 3M tape was cut in several segments so as to contour to a disc shaped base. I made the 3D printed rectangular base with the hopes of getting more surface contact and a uniform install of the mounting tape, which is why I removed my first install of 3M tape and ""upgraded to this""

With the backstory over, after 3 days of use I experienced complete failure on all of the retrofitted units which used Gorilla Mounting Tape. The units weigh less than one pound each and utilized approximately 12 square inches of Gorilla Mounting Tape, which is far more than what is recommended. Only to result in complete failure and the small solar panel falling to the ground.

The solar panel in question are the ones included with Solar LED String Lightings sold here on amazon. Theyre as small as the palm of your hand with the internal contents consisting of a AA Lithium Ion batter and small PCB board.

In 1998 though Sheaffer was bought up by a German company, which proceeded to reformulate this ink. They also changed the ink bottle to the current design. The new bottle is actually an improvement (it is much harder to tip over), but the  ink inside is virtually unusable in most pens and on most papers. Not only is it very dry and scratchy, it dries much too quickly and so tends to clog my pens very badly.

I am puzzled why the people here like Skrip so much. Do yourself a favor and try Parker Quink, if you use black ink; it is rich and very smooth, and rarely clogs.

This is supposed to be a 14 sheet shredder.  It comes with a feature that measures the thickness of each item, and will not shred if the item exceeds the supported thickness of the unit.

I'm not exactly sure how Fellowes translates 14 sheets, but I am unable to insert many, if not most items into my shredder.  For example, I cannot shred any credit card offers, bank statements in envelopes or anything sent to me in an envelope that I want to shred without opening the envelope, extracting the contents and expanding the sheets.  This is inconvenient as much of what I shred are credit card offers, other special offers and account statements for which I have electronic copies.

Another issue that I have with this shredder input is just a bit more than 11"" wide.  Most envelopes are slightly larger.  This prevents me from horizontally shredding those envelopes that do fit, forcing me to take more time shredding vertically.

Finally, the bin on this shredder is flimsy and not easy to replace into the shredder.  This is a minor annoyance, but annoying nonetheless.

I'm going to relocate this shredder to a more suitable place, such as my trash bin, as soon as I find a better option.  If you shred one or two sheets at a time, then this shredder is for you.

I'm attaching a picture so you can see how even this simple task is not accomplished. Every other place I tried to use them they also failed. The reason they fail is because the side of the fastener that contains the fuzzy part loses all of its fabric within about a week. See the photo and you'll see that what little fabric was ther to begin with is gone. There is nothing left for the gripper part to hold on to. Velcro should be quite ashamed to put their otherwise good brand on such a bad product.

The second thing I would say is that even if you used a pencil to write on it I'm sure it would show straight through the next page that is if it would even make it that far and not get ripped in the process of actually writing your note/reminder/etc.

What I received is a plain glass 3 oz bottle with no label on the bottle, whatsoever - in a white box with one sepia ink illustration of a leaping catfish on each side.  The outside of the bottle had dried ink spilled on it.  The cap was tightly sealed; it did not appear to have leaked during shipping.  The ink was filled to within 1/8"" +/- of the top of the bottle.

I filled my art pens (broad nib first) using a converter by CAREFULLY inserting the Nib into the ink and drawing the ink through the nib into converter's reservoir.  With a damp cloth I then cleaned the ink off the nib and started drawing ink through the converter to nib feed.  I was able to draw some very nice, very black broad lines.  I then repeated this process for my Medium and Extra fine nib pens. At which point I took a break made and eat lunch, about a forty minute break.  Coming back to the pens - none of them would write.  I tried to redraw the ink through the nibs with both damp, dry and wet cloth.  It  would appear to start drawing, but all of the pens -  would not write.  I had to dump the ink fill the converter with warm water and gradually I was able to clear the dried ink out of each of the nibs.  Later I tried to fill the broad and fine nib pens again - with the same results.  All of my RotRing art pens work perfectly (EF and medium both write with fine lines; Broad and Fine both write with broad lines) with both RotRing Art pen black ink and Pelikan brillant black ink cartridges.

The printer is really quiet, and it prints at a good speed. I really like the looks of it. I have a dark wood desk, and you almost forget this black printer is there because it's really low profile. I would guess it's around 6-7"" tall. The printer never disconnects from our U-verse network, and it responds pretty quickly when a print request is sent. The ink cartridge doesn't last as long as some printers I've owned.

ISSUE #1: I tried to scan a sheet of paper to email it to someone. I put the sheet on the scanner, opened the printer program, and started a scan. The scanner just kept saying ""Scanning..."" with a little rolling bar. It was taking forever, so we just left to eat at a restaurant. When I came home, the scanner still said ""Scanning..."" just like when I left, and the computer was in sleep mode. When I hit ""Cancel"", it started saying ""Canceling..."" forever, until I turned the printer off. That happened when I selected the scan as a document and a .jpeg picture. It repeated that problem whether I initiated a scan through the computer or the printer itself.

ISSUE #2: I decided to contact HP to ask for help on why my scanner wasn't working. I looked around their FAQ's on their website, and the website was cumbersome with little useful information. I decided to contact HP for help. When I wrote out the issues I was having (explained in Issue #1), I went to submit the contact form. The website asked me to prove I was still under warranty with a proof of purchase or other means. I couldn't even send a contact form! Like I said earlier, it was a gift, and apparently my warranty is up after 1 year. I thought HP was a name brand, and that would mean something. I have to say HP's customer support is non-existent.

It was incredibly complicated to set up, especially with no screen on it to follow prompts. I used my cellphone with the Canon App to set up the printer the first time. This was an incredibly long and drawn out process that took both me and my tech savvy husband to try to complete.

I actually really liked my Epson printer until it came time to replace the ink cartridges. I always look at the replacement cartridge prices before I buy, and the Epson were cheap. However, I soon found out that the minds at Epson went to VERY great lengths to make sure you can use only genuine, way-over priced genuine Epson cartridges in their printer. The aftermarket cartridges won't be recognized by the printer, and even the empty refillable cartridges won't work either. Dont bother with the bottles of ink to refill your existing Epson cartridges, for that won't work either.

I could have bought 4 black and 2 each of the other three colors for $14 for the aftermarket products. Instead, the cheapest I could find for the same 10 Epson cartridges cost over $80. Actually they weren't the same, the aftermarket were the larger capacity (model 200XL) where the Epson cartridges at $80 were the smaller capacity (model 200).

1.0,False,"09 4, 2013",A35X02N2M618UY,B005F6NMYU,{'Size:': ' 100 Sheets'},Roger E.,"I've been ordering and using Digi Orange labels for a very long time and they've always been high quality, thick paper, easy to peel and stuck on well. In July I ordered a few more packs of them and tucked them away in my drawer to be ready to use when I had finished up using my previous package of them. Fast forward to a week ago, late August 2013 and I've finally gotten around to opening the newly purchased ones. I noticed immediately that they looked different. The ""digi orange"" orange & black logo on the back of the paper was faded. Not just the type of fading that happens over time. The type of fading that happens when a manufacturer decides they want to save money on ink. I noticed it, but didn't think it was that big of a deal, I can understand trying to save money on something like that since it's just a piece that everyone is going to peel off and toss away anyway. The next thing I noticed was that the weight of the paper was quite a bit less than the previous labels. The previous labels could be held by the edge and were thick enough that they wouldn't bend when held up in the air. These new labels aren't much thicker than a standard sheet of notebook paper. I gave them a shot anyway and began to print a few things on them. They printed fairly well, but even the printed(white) side seems to be a much duller shade of white than the previous labels. At this point I ran into the biggest obstacle. Trying to peel these sheets without unintentionally ripping the label is nearly impossible, no matter how gentle you are with it. The issue of the lighter weight paper immediately comes into play and you end up with holes and creases. I will now be looking for alternatives to Digi Orange. They served me well while they were keeping a quality standard, but this change, for me at least, makes them no longer a viable and reliable option for shipping labels.","Quality has changed, summer 2013, buyer beware!",1378252800,,
1.0,True,"02 12, 2016",A3NAAXO411HVFI,B01B3HGYEY,{'Size:': ' Bamboo Pen with Bamboo Case'},Euro Traveler,"Writes very well, and with the matching box it is a good pen to own, show and use.  Unlike most pens with German nibs, this one tends toward a Fine line rather than Medium, not unlike the Asian pens.  The included converter works well, and the pen should also work with universal ink cartridges (not included).
  There are some issues, though:  1) The cap is VERY difficult to take off to use the pen; but trying to put it back on I feared pushing too hard.  In fact, I almost returned the pen as ""broken"" - which it is not.  The clearances are so tight that there is an audible ""snap"" when putting it back on.  I hope that the bamboo will hold up to this action over time, but I am not too confident.  2) The pen measures a reasonable 146mm capped but a l-o-n-g 175mm posted (6 7/8"")!  When posted, the cap does not seat well anyway, so the pen probably will be used unposted (127mm).  3) Personally, I do not like the large ""Zenzoi"" name carved into the side of the cap.  I understanding the manufacturing pride, but it would be preferable to make it about 1/2 the size it is now.  4) The wood used for the body and for the cap do not match well, which is not unusual for real wood from different pieces; but a better match could have been made.

FOLLOWUP:  Pen did not hold up well.  Probably due to the tightness mentioned when the cap is ""SNAPped"" on, the Nib section broke just below the gold ring and remained in the cap.  Others also mentioned this problem - it just took longer on mine (my gentle persuasion in removing the cap each time).  Wrote well when it was working, though.  If/when this problem is resolved, I could recommend it; but until then I would not recommend it.",Nice pen that writes well but needs some manufacturing attention.

The low rating isn't so much a reflection on the product as it is on the product's packaging. The manufacturer, Epson, knows that it has more than one type of Picturemate system on the market and that the cartridges are not compatible across all Picturemate models - yet the packaging does not state anywhere with which models the print pack is or isn't compatible. This oversight could be easily fixed by adding information to the packaging.","WARNING! Not for PictureMate Pal, Snap, or Flash",1178668800,41,

I am a huge fan of coloring.  I have been coloring almost my entire life.  I was coloring with gel pens long before it was a fad.  In my early teens gel pen became popular and we started using them to color.  Since adult coloring books weren't a thing back then we had to find the more detailed things to color and fuzzy posters were the best for that.  Fuzzy posters were great to color with gel pens because many of them had a lot of fine detail.

Unfortunately, gel pens didn't have the best reputation back then.  They stopped working a lot, if they even worked to begin with.  They were bad about skipping colors and coloring sections would have different shades due to the flow not being consistent so I was really excited to see the adult coloring book fad bringing back gel pens and that gel pens were of better quality.  I recently purchased 2 packs of gel pens and wanted an additional set so I could have a better variety of colors.

These Gel Pens by Lolliz come in 2 packs of 48.  Each pack is exactly the same.  They each come in a clear box that can be reused.  There are rows in each pack and each row can be removed individually.  The pens are clipped onto a plastic divider.  I really love this feature and it's very useful.

As you can see, there aren't 48 individual colors.  There are 42.  The swirls have 3 with the same color combination.  I can get over that but I would prefer honesty up front.

The real reason why I am disappointed in these pens is that they're awful.  I've been using many of them and they stop and start so much that it's too frustrating and I cannot enjoy my coloring anymore.  I've even had holes torn in my paper because I had to go over the same spot so many times because the ink wasn't flowing out.

Also, they're emptying really fast.  I colored in a small section and lost 1/4th of my neon green pen already.  That's a lot for such a small section.  I even checked it compared to my other sets which I have been coloring a lot with and they're barely at 1/4th loss yet.

Due to my experience with them I cannot recommend them but some people have had good luck with them.  Who knows.  What I do know is that next time I will spend a little more and get another set.  I was trying to be frugal and found these at a good price.  My bad!

It doesn't come with batteries, so I got 4 brand-new AA batteries from the package and installed those.  When starting to sharpen, I was surprised at how ""anemic"" the action sounded.  It was necessary to grab the sharpener firmly and also to rotate the pencil a bit to make sure it was sharpened evenly.  It didn't put a sharp point on Sanford #2 or the Eberhard Faber Colorbrite, but did give a lovely point on the softer Faber Castell Coloray; in all cases, however, it apparently decided it was ""done"" sharpening as there is a ""sharp stop"" feature that prevents ""oversharpening.""

Unfortunately, after sharpening six pencils (at least, after sharpening them to the satisfaction of the sharpener), it stopped working.  Changing batteries (I put these non-rechargeable batteries in the tester to make sure all four were good) and re-seating the shavings tray didn't help, so I gave it a couple of firm smacks, which brought it back to life for a bit, but it stopped working again after a couple more pencils.

Well, the Sharpie Liquid Pencil is one of those products that make you think exactly that. Now, I do applaud Sharpie for coming up with the concept. A pencil that writes like a gel pen but is erasable is a fantastic idea and certainly a product I would love to own.

Unfortunately, Sharpie stumbles in the execution part (and one can only think that some competitive product was about to hit the market and they wanted to be first). I like the look and I like the ergonomics of the pen. Nice diameter of the barrel, rubberized grip, nicely done. Once you click to reveal the tip, you will immediately notice that now the top just flops around if you hold the pen upside down. Not optimal, but I'll even let that one slide.

The real problem is that it is impossible to use this product. You will not be able to produce a good line, whether you hold the pen lightly or if you press hard. There is no guarantee it will write anything. As you move the tip along on the paper. suddenly a line appears. Just as magically, it disappears. Naturally, I am thinking it is the quality of the paper, but no, this pencil refuses to properly write on even the most expensive Rhodia or Moleskine notebooks and pads in a reliable manner.

Until Sharpie comes around and either fixes or withdraws the product, I'll stick to my standard mechanical pencils, my Palomino Blackwings or, if I want something special, the Pilot Frixion erasable gel ink pens.

From here on out I will ALWAYS make sure the products I'm ordering are fulfilled by Pro Packaging.
I'm about to place an order for a 700ft roll by Pro Packaging at this link, which actually ends up being cheaper than the 350ft roll if you can afford it: http://www.amazon.com/16-inch-Cushioning-700-foot-12-inch-Perforated/dp/B001GHOO8U

My biggest complaint about MJ is the voice call quality and dropped calls. Often, the person you are talking to can't hear you and you have to repeat yourself a lot during MJ to landline or mobile phone conversations. The second thing I hate about MJ is the echo you get frequently. This drives me absolutely crazy when having a phone conversation. You say ""hello"" for example and then you hear the echo ""hello"" back or whatever it is that you said. This is very distracting and annoying. I suppose you get what you pay for. I have been using MJ for many years. I was even dumb enough to purchase a 5 year service contract but after it expires, I will not renew. Their customer support also sucks. They don't even have a toll free 1-800 number to call if you have a problem. You have to get online and establish a chat connection for tech. support. I know they will tell you they have to do this to keep costs down but this is horrible. I predict this company will eventually go belly up due to the poor call quality and customer support. I just purchased an Obi VOIP phone adapter to try out with google voice. I hope this will be a lot better positive experience than what I've had with MJ for the last few years. No matter how cheap the device or service, I personally still demand a min. level of quality that is acceptable to me. MJ has fallen way below that level so they have now lost a customer for life.

Once I got this printer all set up, there were problems from the start. Once I installed the necessary included software onto my computer, it failed to detect it. I check my USB cable, that was fine. I checked to see if the printer was plugged in correctly, it was. However, since I have Windows 7, I thought possibly I needed an updated printer driver. I checked their website and they did have a Windows 7 driver available for download. I download then installed it on my computer. I was still having problems. I called Epson. A tech support technician walked me through a few steps and we finally got the printer to work correctly.

Once I started printing, right away I was unimpressed with the print quality. While black and white printing was good, the output in color was average at best. The color is off on a lot of my printouts and it doesn't compare to my other printer. It's actually quite a bit worse. I've tried all kinds of paper types and weights of several different brands. I've tried tweaking the printer settings. Nothing seemed to work. This printer comes with series 68 inks(the high capacity inks) which I don't think was meant for great print quality. I figured maybe if I get the 69 series inks, which according to Epson's website, it's supposed to produce better quality prints, that would do the trick. I never got the chance to find out.

Fast forward.

Today, 12-22-09, I got my new 69 series inks. When I went to turn on the printer to install them, the printer started malfunctioning. The green power light started blinking and shut off, then the printer started grabbing the loaded paper half way then it stopped. This resulted in the paper getting jammed in the printer. Then the load paper and load ink lights started blinking orange in unison. I had to forcefully pull out the jammed paper. I turned off the printer and took out the paper from the top feeding tray. I turned the printer back on and again the same thing started happening except this time it kept grabbing for paper which wasn't there and again the orange lights would continuously blink. I barely used this printer because it was only intended for use if I need to print to larger paper. My main printer is my old Canon MX850.

I called Epson and got a tech support technician. He walked me through a few troubleshooting steps and nothing seemed to work. Finally he told me this printer is experiencing a hardware failure and there was no fix. He offered to replace it but since it was within Amazon's 30-day window plus the extended holiday return period which I believe ends 1-31-10, I opted to just ship it back to Amazon and look for another brand printer.

I purchased this printer because like I said, I needed it mainly for printing on large formats. I also purchased it because of the incredible price and great reviews. I had high hopes for this printer and I'm really disappointed with it. I have had a previous bad experience with another model Epson printer but I didn't let that dissuade me from getting this one because I believe just because one has a problem with a particular model of a brand doesn't mean it should tarnish their whole line of products. However, that's two for two and now I'm rethinking that idea. I'm sorry that my luck isn't as good as everyone else's but this is my honest experience with this product. I did plan on keeping it even though I initially wasn't impressed with the print quality until it started malfunctioning for no apparent reason.",So-so print quality and dead in less than a month...,1261440000,18,

It seems they forgot to-re ink the thing before they sent it out all packaged up and I just got a used up cartridge.
For the money I did not save I'll stick with a new HP cartridge from here on out. the price on these seemed fair but, with the shortage of ink not even free is worth the price and or effort. The bad thing is the last set worked just fine so I reordered thinking I would get the same descent quality.****

The metal scoop on the end is not wide enough or long enough to pull staples out of stacks of more than about 5 sheets of paper.

Staples that are removed, usually get stuck in the remover.  The Swingline does have some type of lever on it that you slide forward, which is designed to push the removed staple off of the device.

the other two laminators were heavy duty with a variable knob, and required a sleeve for each pouch.  this scotch thermal laminator, without a sleeve, was still not hot enough to laminate a 5 mil laminating pouch.  even after waiting 20 minutes for it to warm up, there would be splotches where the laminate pouch would not adhere because there was insufficient heat.

the specs say that it's supposed to be able to laminate up to a 5 mil pouch, but in my experience, it can't handle the job.  we ended up not using this laminator, and relying on the other two.  in addition, the housing is made out of cheap plastic.

my guess is that others who are rating this unit 5 stars probably are using a 3 mil or thinner pouch.

It's at least 20% smaller than my previous mouse pad, which I guess is fine if you want something for a smaller space.

I have big, clumsy hands and cannot make precise movements so this thing is not thrilling me so far.

I have lowered my rating for this item from *** and will be replacing it with a conventional mouse pad at the earliest opportunity.  The surface of this is similar to the plastic used in 3-D coatings on video box artwork--so imagine scratching your fingernail back and forth across the front of one of those boxes over and over and over and you'll get a pretty good sense of what this thing sounds like.  Maybe it works better with a different mouse model--I have a Logitech M185--but I doubt it.

Not the pen pictured on the box, and inferior to those sold in the past as ""Paper Mate Flair . . .""

The only thing that is the same is the top cover (black, with white plus sign on top).  The rest of the pen is of a flimsier plastic and the ink is not as thick as the prior pens (producing a tinier script).  I only ordered one box, and I had to throw away two of the pens because the tips had disintegrated before I had written a single word. My impression is that the others are not going to last very long, either.

Follow-up:  I wound up throwing most of the pens away in a few days (two tips disintegrated at first touch, the ink on two or three dried up within an hour, another dried up the next day because I failed to put the cap back on, and perhaps only one or two lasted more than a few days.

If you are looking for the old Paper Mate Flair Tip Felt pens (a favorite of mine for many years), don't bother with this one.

I went to Staples to buy them.  They are much more expensive, but they work.  A blister of 4 is about $7.  There was a space for a box of a dozen for about $15, but it was out of stock and no longer listed in the Staples catalog.  I then found a box of a dozen on the Staples web page for $18/dozen, and bought 3 boxes.  They are the real thing and work.

However, I now see that there is an alternative listing for these pens on the Amazon page, PAP8430152, at a price of $13.11 per dozen, obviously the best bargain IF they are the real Flair pen.  Am afraid to try.  If you do decide to buy from Amazon, try this alternate listing, not the one on this page.  Would like to hear from other users as to their experience with this other pen.",Not the same as prior Paper Mate Flair Pens--this is inferior,1319241600,24,

I run 2 businesses and so paperwork can mount up.  A few years ago I saw the ad for Neat scanner and thought, awesome, I can scan everything and get rid of my file cabinet!  The idea sounded better in my head than how this performs.

I'll keep this very short and sweet.  If you are going to use a scanner for your business, or even if you want something like this for your home, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend not getting this.  Instead get the Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500.  I owned the Neat scanner for 2 years with my first restaurant and Have always had a headache of thinking I've scanned a document in and then come to find out my document of 10 pages is only 6 in my .pdf.  And not only that, but if there is a small, very small bend in the corner, the scanner will jam, everytime!  When I started my second restaurant, I wanted to do the same thing with scanning everything in and getting rid of the file cabinet.  So I did some research to see what was better.  And I ended up buying the ScanSnap ix500 for my business.  It has never jammed at all.  If it scans pages that are stuck together, it knows and prompts you on the screen that 2 pages are stuck together.

Like I said, I never ever review things.  But this thing is a piece of crap.  If this review can stop just one person from buying this, I'd be happy.

When I first opened the box I ""thought"" I was impressed with the quality feel of it's build...but soon learned it is just a thicker plastic crappy body versus thinner plastic.  Most would think, ""Hey, thicker plastic...sounds stronger""....uh no, just more cumbersome and heavy for no reason because the doors and hinges are still fragile.  The tray you see sticking out of the back is removable to make storing it a bit easier because you will want to store it.  There are no doors or covers to close off the back of the unit, which is where you feed the paper object in you want to laminate....this is a stupid design because it leaves the laminating roll open to dust and whatever things are floating around in the air settling on your desk or wherever you store this (think animal fur and dust balls....LOTS of them because this sucker is LOADED with static and will attract EVERYTHING that comes near it).  The rear opening is just 2 layers of tape essentially that come together over your paper...the sticky is all exposed in the rear and if it even catches the smallest hair or dust...helllllllo permanent bubbles on your so-called laminated paper.

Now, using this thing...no heat, so no plug (the only YAY for this thing).  There is a handle on the LEFT side that you rotate slowly in a clockwise direction as you manually push your paper through the back.  The idea is that those 2 sheets of tape will adhere on top & bottom of your paper and pop out the front looking all laminated...and a simply swipe of a razor blade (which is safely contained) will trim the edge leaving your machine ready for the next job...nice theory Scotch.  1st thing, what percentage of the population is right handed versus left handed??  I'm not really sure and don't really care but can say that being right handed I would have preferred that handle to be on the right side since the rotation of that is the most important part of the process.  Getting the rotation timed just right with your other hand pushing the paper through is VERY important...and in my hour of trying this thing, darn near impossible!

Your papers will 95% of the time come out with bubbles and 99.9% of the time have creases, sometimes severe creases.  You can sometimes work the bubbles out by taking a soft towel or something similar and rubbing like your life depends upon it...or sticking a needle in the middle of the hole and also rubbing til you sweat to smooth it out.  The creases...yeah, they aren't going anywhere so learn to like them if you get this machine.  If you are lucky (and it surely is luck cuz this thing is not predictable) and happen to get a paper to come out looking rather good...take a picture because it is probably the last.  As with all laminators, you need to trim the edges, but don't trim too close (needs 1/2"" to remain adhered together) or the ends will unstick and then your paper looks even worse than when it first came out of the machine (who woulda thunk that could be possible?).  EVERYTHING that comes out of it needs to be pressed/rubbed to get it all stuck together because the built-in roller that is supposed to do that is a joke.

I will give Scotch one thing...the roller is super easy to change and comes in a glossy or matte finish.  I haven't had the luxury to try the matte finish...but with the hair that I have pulled outta my head in the past hour, don't think I'm gonna be giving it a try.  For smaller objects (like ID cards), good ol' tape across each side and then trimmed works a heck of a lot better than this...is cheaper and takes less time.  For larger sheets of paper, buy something else or find a Kinkos because this is a total waste of money.  Out of 23 things I laminated in the past hour, 4 look OK and only 1 came out some-what nice.

I have grown so accustomed to not having to hold a headset in hand while speaking, due to my use of the headset/cell phone combination. It's funny to me, as I had asked about a Bluetooth capable cordless home phone years ago and they simply didn't seem to exist. While I'm still getting used to the phone and all of it's features, the convenience of having a Bluetooth earpiece makes this worthy for me. Having an assortment of Bluetooth headsets available made the purchase just that much easier. I have found no problems with any function at this time. Pairing was very easy. Answer function works well in conjunction with my fax being on the same line. Much smaller than the phone I replaced. The one thing I have problem with is, even though your phone book carries a listing of your personal phone numbers, unlike a cell phone, they are not displayed when being called by one. The caller ID requires a subscription in order to function at all. It must be that my cell phone plan has caller id that it works but it took me by surprise at first. I have no second thoughts about recommending this cordless home phone.

I have been looking for a set of pastel markers for a while now and since I had a 60% off coupon to my local store I decided to try these.
The colors included in this set are: #62 wisteria(medium purple), #60 salvia blue(medium blue), #41 blue grey(looks more like a light blue-green), #34 pale green(light Kelly green), #70 peppermint (medium mint), #68 daffodil yellow( medium yellow), #22 lemon yellow (bright yellow), #30 rosewood (caramel), #47 pale pink (light flesh tone), #67 bubble gum pink (medium pink w/ purple undertone) #57 rose pink( medium but brighter pink with red understone) and #66 dusty pink(medium grey pink)
First of all the colors are not really pastel and not as light as advertised. They are a vibrant soft color if that makes any sense. Second, there's no orange hue included. 3 pinks though however the lightest pink is actually a flesh tone. The grey actually comes is more of a sea foam/sea glass/ pale turquoise. There are two yellows and the lemon yellow is super vibrant more of a neon/bright color. My biggest issue is that they are being sold as pastel markers when they're not. The colors are decent just not really as light as you would expect for a $20 artist quality marker set.  The markers are very streaky.

The cartridges that come with the actual printer are only starter, low volume cartridges that will require replacement before you expect it. Even more aggravating, when you call HP's tech support line, they will actually try to sell you more ink. I wonder why?

Sadly, HP provides the worst technical support that I have ever experienced. The telephone reps barely speak English (even worse than other India-based tech support) and the chat reps serve multiple customers at the same time, leading to long delays between their responses. Moreover, I have been cut off during chat sessions five times, which leads me to believe it is intentional as this always seems to happen when I attempt to corner them on difficult questions. Before getting cut off today (5/5/2009) the chat technical support rep acknowledged that there are known incompatibilities between the drivers and Windows XP.

Reasons to hate it:

1) Under Windows 10, if you send a document to it when it is in power save mode, instead of waking it up like a normal wireless printer, it freezes up and you actually have to delete it from the list and add the printer back because restarting the document in the print queue does nothing. So to avoid this routine you have to walk to the printer in the other room and press the button to wake it up before sending a document do it-which kind of defeats the purpose of having a wireless printer.

Other than that I guess it's okay but because of that I hate it, I hate, I hate it.

Update 1 year later: After posting the above, I took the mfr's suggestion in the comment and got a tech to remotely log-in to my desktop. The issue turned out to be an outdated driver, so after he installed the latest driver the printer worked perfectly for the next 12 months. About 6 months ago  I replaced all of the toners for only $84 with non-Samsung toners, as the factory ones were down to about 10%. 2 weeks ago I was able to print no problem, and now last night nothing. After using the (now HP's) Beta virtual assistant, I've concluded that the wireless chip has simply burned out/stopped working, as the blue light will no longer light up after startup-it comes on for about 2 seconds after plugging in the power cord, then goes black. Now I will have to move it into my living room and connect by USB cable, or trying to print from USB thumb drive-both clunky solutions. Other than that, this thing is junk.

I could leave my old Rhino 1000 in my pack.  I was compact and did the job.

The Rhino 4200 came in the worst of the worst rigid plastic clamshell.  Because of it's shape, and included wedge-shaped container for the print cartridge, this was complete exercise in frustration to retrieve the Dymo from its plastic prison.  Once freed, The 4200 needed 6 AA batteries vs 6 AAA's for the 1000.  The label cartridge is also comparatively oversized.

The included ""manual"" is little flip book of icons with no words.  Granted, this is a label maker and not rocket science, but the booklet is incomprehensible.

In the photos, you can see rubberized grips.  Don't be misled into thinking this is to make it easier to hold.  Even a person with very large hands won't be holding it with one hand and tapping buttons with the other. This thing is such an awkward shape, I find it hard to just pick it up.  Don't expect to find it handy for making labels on-the-fly at any job site.  The bigger display on the 4200 is nice, but since you must set it down to use it, the big display is necessary to see what you're typing.

databazaar shipments are NOT in proper HP 11 ink cardboard box which shows expiration.
You find out if they work when you remove foil pouch they are delivered in (no data on pouch).  But when you open you may find they are years out of date (3 of 3 of mine where in 7/2011)

1. Delivered late.
2. Required post office pickup (NO Amazon prime deliveries go to my post office!)
3. This item was received from Data Bazaar WITHOUT the HP DATED cardboard package. (Suspicious?) Just a metallic coated plastic cover with no date.  It sits on printer waiting til the printer demands it (40 days)
3. This past weekend, I open & discover this cartridge expired 3 years ago & does not work at all.  (After 2 trips to post office & phone calls to DataBazaar)
4. Monday AM (yesterday):  I post feedback at Databazar & ALSO order next day HP 11 Yellow ink from Amazon / Amazon Prime (Not databazaar this time)  DataBazaar calls- Says will rush me fresh ink, Will send me a label to ship back their $11 cartridge, Want me to remove my feedback.  They offer to call back tomorrow.  I say ""Please do not call.  I've spent far too much time on this ink cartridge.  Just get me working INK asap. That's all I ask.""
5. Tuesday PM:  My Amazon prime ink is HERE! (thanks amazon prime/UPS!)  Data Bazaar calls again: ""Good news, your replacement ink will be shipping out this evening and get here in 2-3 days.""
6. Thursday: I get 2! replacement yellows from databazaar. UPS & USPS.  They promised they would be very fresh.  They both are without the proper dated HP cardboard.  So even though it may ruin them, I open the sealed metal colored pouch to find they are BOTH 3 years past expiration also.  2008.  Very bad practice.

(So Amazon Prime took my new order & DELIVERED to my door, faster than DataBazaar can get a rush order out the door to solve a problem they caused.)

The details:
This is a yellow hp 11 print cartridge I ordered when my HP printer warned me I'd need ink soon (turned out to be 40 days later).  This item was received from Data Bazaar WITHOUT the HP DATED cardboard package. (Suspicious?) Just a metallic coated plastic cover, sealed, WITHOUT an expiration date.  Then after 40 days or so my printer demanded new yellow ink: the warning light changed from ""caution- low yellow"" to ""Yellow empty- HP 1200D will not print without a new yellow cartridge"".  So I open the aluminum wrapper, to find ink freshly received from DataBazaar that expired in early 2008- over 3 years past expiration. ??

So during an important project, I was stranded without being able to use my main high volume printer.  The old ink from DataBazaar had either dried up, or the HP printer will not allow operation with ink this old.

1.0,False,"04 16, 2016",A173YMJ9XFVRSY,B01B1JFRT2,{'Style:': ' Printer'},Amazon Customer,"I'm going to discuss the order and installation of this printer from beginning to end.
Please keep in mind that I purchased this printer for use in a small law office.
1. Printer is very heavy. It came UPS and labelled ""Team Lift"". It took three people to unpack the printer and lift it onto the desk in my office.
2. This printer is not mobile in any way. I would be concerned with moving office space as it would unbalance the print cartridges and whatever else and make the printer not work.
3. The printer comes with an install CD which I find totally useless. Who has a laptop with a CD drive any more?
4. The install book has a website at which you can go to directly download the driver. It was seamless.
5. The printer does not come with any software.
6. The install software installs a desktop shortcut for HP printer supplies (spam) and tries to change your default browser to bing. It also REPEATEDLY tries to trick you into agreeing to ""provide information"" to HP. I said no once, and then again, and then a third time when I had to do a custom install because HP tries to trick you into installing a 10 MB spyware program ""for product improvement"".
7. The printer took over an hour to ""initialize"" and set up. It print five full color pages as test pages. I personally find it a waste as the printer comes with four print cartridges which cost $380 ($140 for black and $80 for each of the three color cartridges) to replace.
8. The printer is very noisy. If you are not sitting in the same room with the printer, you may not care.
9. My last HP printer kept on cleaning its print cartridges until there was no ink left. It seems as though this printer has the same idea. I really hate HP because of what happened with that old HP multifunction - it would not let me print black and white documents because the color cartridges were empty; it would not let me scan because the color cartridges were empty; it would not let me fax because the color cartridges were empty. And every time you turned on that old MFN, the **** printer would **** clean itself until there was no ink left (yes, even if you just wanted to fax something or print in black and white - EVERY print cartridge was constantly cleaning itself). I HAVE STRONG FEARS that this HP printer will do the same thing and will definitely update my review if and when that happens. (all four cartridges are new right now, so it is a moot point to review). Also I had purchased an ORIGINAL HP ink cartridge and the old MFN would not recognize it and basically bricked my printer.
10. I received this printer through the vine program, but I would NEVER NEVER NEVER pay for an HP printer, it is a sucker's game and eats ink like nobody's business. I have had Canon, Lexmark and Samsung printers that have never done what HP has done. I LOVE my Samsung (ML-2525) - it works like a trooper, and the ink cartridges (ORIGINAL Samsung products) are like $30 for a regular and $50 for an extra large and last me about the whole year. I use a Fuji Scanner ix5000 and it is AMAZING. I don't use a fax (I have an online fax).
11. The printer has its own email address. So you can attach a document and email the printer and it will print it out. It prints out both the document and the email IN COLOR. There are NO OPTIONS to have emailed documents just print in black and white. ALSO there is a data security problem - I am concerned that documents emailed to the printer are stored on HP's server somewhere. This is a problem for me (as a law firm).
12. The printer does have options to copy in black and white or in color.
13. I never used the fax, who has one these days?
14. You can scan to email, but you need to set up options with the HP software on your computer. You are required to give HP your email address and password. (I find this problematic). It scans it as a pdf and emails it to you. You can add a security code for scanning to certain email addresses if you need to.
15. There is a flat bed scanner and ADF scanner.
16. There is only one paper tray, which holds one ream of paper.
17. The touchscreen is not as responsive as it should be (it is like a first generation android phone rather than like a modern day macbook or surface).
18. The printer is sharp looking but not particularly attractive or modern. It looks like something you could have purchased at any time in the past ten to fifteen years.
19. The display pivots upward. (IMHO this is a useless feature).
20. You can scan to USB at the ""walk up port"" located under the display to the left. I did not like the location as my printer is flush against the left wall. It feels cramped. It is awkward if you have a novelty USB drive or pudgy fingers. The whole printer unit is a beast, why is the USB port crammed into the side like that?
Final verdict: I do not find this a cost effective option for a small business. I do not trust HP. I do not want HP to have a copy of all my documents. I do not like that HP tried to change my browser. I do not like that HP tried to install 10 MB of spyware on my computer despite my repeatedly withholding consent. IMHO, this is not something that a trustworthy company would do. My Canon, Lexmark and Samsung have never done such a thing. I think the ink cartridge refills are hideously expensive ($140 for the black cartridge and $80 a cartridge for each color cartridge - that is $380 every time the printer needs new ink!!). Based on my very simple testing of the unit, the black and pink cartridges are already showing a decrease in capacity (and I have only done the mandatory 5 page test, one copy of my resume, and one copy of my driver's license).
SO: I am taking off one star for expensive ink, one star for spyware and browser trickery, and one star for lack of data security. That brings it to two stars. I will update this review again when the ink runs low to report whether HP cripples the whole unit until you pay for one of their print cartridges (I speak as a past HP customer, so beware!!!!!).
Personal recommendation: NEVER buy any HP product, the company does not stand behind its products, and their sole goal is to scr*w you out of your money. (Yes, I am holding a strong grudge because of that old HP MFN from years ago - my business was new and I could not afford to replace the old MFN, which meant I was essentially held ransom by HP for their expensive ink - which I DID buy! and the printer did not recognize, HP customer service did not care, and the old MFN was bricked in the end).
Based on my personal experience, I would STRONGLY recommend Samsung for a high quality workhorse product that lasts years, with some of the lowest cost ink cartridge refills in the industry. Just.. don't buy this. Really really don't. Really. Save yourself, save your money.

UPDATE: SEPT 2016: ANOTHER STAR TAKEN AWAY FOR THE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE. HP is a horrid company. My printer suddenly went offline. I was using it on a network. The internet was working. The computer was on the network. According to the network status report all was well, but the printer was offline. I checked my Windows 10 was up to date; it was. I checked my printer options - printer was not offline, no printing was paused. All was well, the printer just would not print. There is NO phone number for customer service. You need to use your serial number and chat with a CSR. After over an HOUR with their (I'm guessing based on the name) overseas customer service chat, the CSR ended our chat and told me to contact HP chat again in 72 hours when my case number would be in the system. O-kay then. HP's survey popped up, I gave him low marks. Then I got an email from the same CSR saying that ""the chat was disconnected without a resolution"". No apologies, nothing. He then suggests I go to the website, use the forums, or try the chat again. Great. It would be cheaper to just buy a better printer than waste my life with HP's customer service. I really hate this, this is the second HP printer that's been like a demon possessed. I'm going to get rid of this piece of useless cr ap and go back to my lovely Samsung.

This indicates the axles are not quite parallel, and that is not adjustable.  After considering whether bending it into going straight would work, it seems unlikely that would accomplish anything but springing the frame completely out of shape.

Slip the picture in the top like a toaster, push the door closed, and scan.  It even uses the USB cable for power:  no kludgy AC adapters to snake behind the desk and find a slot for on your overburdened power strip.

Unfortunately, nothing else about the VuPoint makes it worth this little amount of effort:  there are no Windows 7 drivers.  The Vista drivers are 32-bit only.  The XP drivers will work on XP, at which point you'll discover that the 'scan' quality is extremely poor.  If I want to scan family photos, I'm not going to demand that decades-old paper gets tons of quality from a device that costs this little...but I do expect it to work better than the 8-year-old HP ScanJet I used to have and sadly it doesn't.  The few pictures I tried gave me the impression the camera inside is fairly low resolution and its picture-taking is augmented by a cheap, harsh LED flash (you can see it at the border of the frame in the form of a bright hotspot).

The VuPoint website is dirt-simple to use, but doesn't really do anything to alleviate your pain shy of offering a download of the dreadfully-written manual or a zipped up folder of drivers ""for Windows"".  I can't tell which version or how new they are.

Pressing a button to begin the scan doesn't launch any VuPoint software:  it opens the Scanner & Camera Wizard in Windows XP.  In short, it's not really giving you anything more than a conventional scanner, but it is giving you a whole lot less.

Once the connection is set, connection has to be manually recreated every few hours - a 5 to 10 minute process.  It loses the connection easily and it does NOT automatically recreate the connection like other wifi devices do.  I have to reset the machine to ""default settings"" and start from scratch.

None of my other wifi devices have this problem.  They all find the router easily and if they lose it, they find it automatically, let alone having to begin from scratch.

I have spent time with their technical support on the telephone, numerous times, who confirmed that this is NORMAL behavior. Also, my router is very reliable when it comes to other devices.  Even guests visiting with devices have no trouble using the wifi.

The Brother machine seems to use its own proprietary approach to wireless and therein lies a problem.  That is, you have to load special software onto every machine that will print wireless.  So don't expect guests with computers using your wifi to easily print from their computers via wifi unless you invest the time to load the software.

The user interface for other functions is very kludgey and unreliable. I often have trouble getting this thing just to make a copy.  Seriously.

Overall I feel that I wasted $300 and a lot of time.  You know, I research so carefully before I buy; I read reviews, make comparisons, and review product literature.  Buying this piece - particularly for the purpose of printing wireless - was a VERY bad move.

PS: If you check my history of Amazon reviews, I think you will find it is rare that I am as unhappy with a product let alone furious as I am with this one and this company.

I purchased 2 sets of these. The seller sent one. I had to write and tell them to send the second set.
I purchased these BEFORE my ink completely ran out. The night it DID run out (Labor Day) , I opened the new cartridges. They looked somewhat different from the ones that I had. I SHOULD have stopped there but I didn't. Admittedly the model numbers seemed to compare. So I thought they might be just made a bit differently. I stupidly installed them. That was a big mistake. I attempted to run the printer. It gave me error messages that the cartridges were empty except for the blue (cyan) I ran a couple of cleaning cycles. The same cartridges still were claimed to be empty. I removed the red (magenta). it WAS empty. I ""thought"" it was full when I installed it but a window showed empty. I installed the other new one. Likewise for the yellow which also seemed empty. I removed the black and it showed empty as well. By THIS time I saw what was happening. The ink was running out of the front of the printer and onto the table and the floor. It destroyed papers (that I had printed) on the floor, as well as the carpet. I wadded up a bunch of toilet paper and packed it under the corner where it was leaking from but the damage was already done. The printer was full of ink. as well as the damages already mentioned.

I needed a feeding scanner for business though, as my older hp printer just had the flatbed that I had to load one page at a time.  This printer was a great price at the time I bought it, and it had all the features I needed.

Pros of the printer:  Scanning is second to none.  The scans on this thing look 100 times better than the garbage scans our $10,000 commercial printer at work makes.  Prints black like a champ.  Dual paper trays (I don't need them, but for many people, it would be really handy).  Intuitive touchscreen.

Cons of the printer:  First, I could never get it set up on wifi.  I am very tech savvy, and had no problem getting my old HP set up on wifi in less than 5 minutes.  I just connected it to my computer instead, but it's a pain for my wife who used to print stuff all the time from her laptop.  Now she has to come to my computer, load it up on here, and then print.  Second, and biggest deal.  The yellow print head clogged after about 5 months, and no amount of cleanings ever got it to unclog.  Epsons are absolutely infamous for clogged heads.  I foolishly misplaced my receipt, and so no luck getting it replaced under warranty.

I would actually like the printer better than the HP, simply due to the design and features for the price, except for the 2 major problems I mentioned.",Garbage,1422662400,2,

and they are pretty good - until you run out of ink.

The Ink can print you about 2-3 months worth if used every
other day or so.  But our customers, including ourselves,
have had nothing but head aches when it comes to changing
Ink Cartridges.  47 Customers have complained it will NOT
 ACCEPT 'GENUINE' Epson Cartridges.  We owned 4 of them and
all 4 are currently wrapped up in their boxes ready to throw
out or send to a recycling center.  All 4 printers
printed through 1 ink cycle - then they started rejecting all
 ink replacements.  We bought ink here at Amazon - rejected.
 We tried the tech trick of pulling out the electrical cord,
 and the USB cord, and it did accept 2 or 3 cartridges,
but eventually it started to reject all of them in time.
Keep in mind this printer has gotten fairy good reviews
the past year - some individuals are being successful
with the printer but we suspect many reviews were
written before their 1st ink cycle went dry.

We noticed that (after installing  the printers) The Epson
software started accessing the internet (or at least trying
to).  This was to block any 3rd party Ink cartridges - because
on one of the printers that WAS NOT on the internet - it actually
acceptable 1 black ink 3rd party cartridge.  The rest were
rejected - even the ""Genuine"" Epson Cartridges.

Its difficult enough to have to purchase expensive
""Genuine"" ink for these printers - but to have them
rejected by your fairly new printer is appalling.  We
have over 46 ""genuine"" ink cartridges that have been
returned to us (we no longer sell the ink).  We used
some of the ""rejected"" ink on our Epson R260 models
and R280 model  (those printers accepted the ink)
simply because the R260, R280 and this model -
""artisan"" 50 use the same ink cartridge.

Customers have explained to us this printer model
has difficulty on accepting new cartridges - no matter
where you purchased them. We have contacted
Epson by email, phone - even writing them a letter,
but they yet to even try to return our messages.
Customers who have purchase this model, and have
not been subjected by the cartridge problem are very
fortunate and we are happy for them.

Overall, Epson has made this printer so INK
CARTRIDGE RESTRICTIVE that it has made us
impossible to recommend to anyone or even
give out for free.

While printing through its first ink cycle, it did
produce fine photos and fairly good text docs,
but after the ink was done - it seems so was
the printer.

Update:  We installed a CISS system on one
of the printers on Feb 1 2011: rejected.
On January 20th, the same model rejected
""Genuine ink"" from a major store front.  We
were fortunate to receive a refund on both
occasions.  We aren't trying anymore.  Epson
keeps ignoring our calls.

In fact, I came here to see whether other people have had the problems I have with these pens, and was surprised that not even the negative reviewers mention it. Maybe there's some magic treatment these pens are supposed to get; if someone can think of something I'm doing that causes these pens to fail, please, please tell me, because I'd love them if they didn't fail.

Three or four months ago I tried the Frixion and was delighted with their clean erasure, even though the ink is more grey than black and the writing isn't fine at all. I bought two three-packs and distributed them around my home, putting one in any drawer where I might want a pen (I'm pretty forgetful). I used two at my desk regularly for a month or so, but then went on a Uni-ball Jetstream kick for a while. A few weeks ago I tried to write with the one in my nightstand that I'd never used and it didn't write. I tried shaking it (like a thermometer), scribbling madly on paper, tapping it against furniture, but nothing worked. Ah well, I thought, it must be a lemon, and threw it into the trash. Then the same thing happened with the pens in my car and purse, but each time I just got disgusted, as one does when a pen dies, and threw it out.

Today I picked up one of the Frixion pens that I'd used for a month and sat idly in my desk organizer ever since, and it didn't write either. Neither did the other one in the organizer, or the colored Frixion pen I'd bought for kicks but had only used a few times right after I bought it. This time I was determined. I shook, scribbled, tapped, and cursed; then it occurred to me that maybe the ink was gummed up and would soften if it were heated a little, so I stood the ink barrels in an inch of hot tap water for ten minutes or so. Then, after a lot more shaking the pens out, tapping the tips hard on the desk, and cursing, two of them revived. The third didn't, even after a second bath. Mysteriously, the two pens that now work have less ink in them than the dead one, which is still almost 2/3 full.

Out of two three-packs of black pens and a single colored one, I now have one black and one colored pen, and it seems probable that they'll both need TLC to keep them functioning. Even if I could have forced a few of the ones I threw out to work, that's still a lot of wasted money. More importantly, a new pen that's been sitting in a drawer or a lightly used one standing in a desk organizer idle for a few months should work instantly.

The paper jams quite often and the paper catch tray on top isn't big enough - If you print a large document (say, a thesis or research paper) the pages become disorganized and sometimes even fall onto the floor!

The printer seems to only take regular paper as well, it jams whenever I try to put avery labels or slightly thicker coloured paper in the tray.

I spent hours reading technical specifications and I was looking for one particular piece of data.  Two years ago I bought a one line Panasonic wireless, and only after a few weeks of using it, with its monochrome display screen, did I learn that Panasonic also had the same phone, slightly different model number, with a color display screen, for only about $20 more.  I found, at my advanced age, I could not read or use the monochrome screen, but the color screen was fine.  It was too late, I had bought the monochrome first and did not bother to return it to Office Depot.

This time, first, I trusted Amazon to give an honest story.  I also checked other sources to buy the same phone, even one at a lower price.  I read with great care.  I found no reference anywhere to whether the display was monochrome or color.  I bought the system from Amazon.  They arrived today and they are all monochrome.  I called Panasonic.  They said they don't make a color display model.  (I think they soon will, but they want to sell this cheaper one first?)  I told them I wanted to return the whole set -- I could not easily see or read the monochrome display.  They told me I would have to ask Amazon for a refund.  I spent more hours looking and could not find a single 2-line cordless system that gives any assurance of a colored display screen.  So, I'll keep this one and be very very careful to call and ask some real person about any questions I have -- the web it NOT the safest place to buy.

I posted more review, and now want to report that the Amazon return policy amazed me -- no questions asked, they accepted my return for a refund.

Also I learned, after buying, that my intended phone service, Time Warner, could provide two phone lines, but they would not ""roll over"" so that if line 1 is busy it automatically goes to line 2.

With that type of service from Time Warner, no type of ""2 line"" phone would be very good.

Newer Wi-Fi routers don't support 802.11b by defaultand sometimes not at all. By enabling 802.11b on your new, fast 802.11ac Wi-Fi router, you'll slow down every device on your network. Fitbit could fix this by re-engineering the Aria to use a newer chip that supports 802.11g or 802.11n, but they haven't.

As a scale, it works well enough, and has good battery life. To access the readings online, you'll need to use Fitbit's proprietary website or app; it doesn't support Apple HomeKit, for example. Getting data out of the Fitbit site to share with, say, a physician is not easy.

While my Aria lasted until I discarded it (because it was killing Wi-Fi speeds for my whole family), other Fitbit products I've owned haven't fared so well. It doesn't seem to me that build quality is high on Fitbit's list of priorities. Neither is customer support; previously, they would replace a clearly defective product if it failed just outside of warranty. Nowadays, they hide behind the exact terms of the warranty, even for failures that are clearly their fault. So I can't recommend the company's products generally.

Start with a better product by not even spending more money, just by putting a few products together yourself.  Even for a beginner, if you are starting with such low quality you can't see your true potential because you are being stunted by the products you are using.

2. Platinum Preppy or Pilot- just by a set of the disposables to get used to using fountain pens.  You get the color variety.  Downside is that you don't get the wider nibs

3. Pilot Parallel-  YES.  explore the wider nibs with the true feel of a fountain pen.  You can even mix colors.  Buy individually or as a set, and purchase the 12 pack of colors.  Highly recommended as a ""Beginner"" set.  don't settle for less.

4. LAMY Safari and Al-Star.  German quality at it's finest.  Superb feel whether the plastic or brushed aluminum.  Contoured for your fingers.  Nibs are so smooth and are interchangeable.  ExFine, Fine, Medium, and also 1.1, 1.5, and 1.9 for the calligraphy nibs.  Purchase the refill cartridges and these will last a lifetime.

You cannot print anything if the Black cartridge signals it is out of ink.. The printer prevents all printing.  In truth, there is still ink left in the cartridge to use. It's a serious problem and was the subject of worldwide lawsuits which Epson chose to settle in the USA.  The printer will allow you to continue if one of the color cartridges is out.

1. This printer has the lowest cost black ink. That is 100% true. But what they fail to mention is that even if you set the printer to only print black and no color, it will still use color! Yes... it uses color even if you don't want it. They say that it is necessary to make the black. Bull. And you cannot run the printer without the color cartridges in place and with ink available. Tricky and unethical.

2. According to Lexmark, you won't have a five year warranty unless you register the printer with them and keep a copy of your confirmation email from Lexmark that the printer was registered. Otherwise, they claim it only has a one year warranty. I had my confirmations saved on my old yahoo mail account which I recently had to close because it got infected.

Or a lot of times it decides it doesn't want to print the whole document.  It will print a page and a half and then just stop.  This happens frequently.  Note: We finally plugged it in to the computer directly instead of using wifi...which fixed this problem.  This printer wastes so much time it's not even funny though.  It's always something.  If you enjoy problem solving and troubleshooting things...and you have a lot of time to do it, you'll really like this printer.  It's also true what other reviewers are saying about the ink.  It goes through ink very, very fast.  We don't print a ton...maybe 5-10 pages per day, but the last XL black ink we purchased 3 weeks ago is already empty.  Oh yeah...and this is one of those printers that will not print if even ONE ink cartridge is out.  Forget the fact it has TWO black ink cartridges!  If I had it to do over, I definitely would not purchase this printer.  UPDATE: This printer lasted exactly two years and has been nothing but trouble the entire time.  The price tag is WAY too high for such a piece of trash.  I am very good at fixing broken computer equipment (printers included).  Canon makes it virtually impossible to repair their printers.  They truly make them to throw away.  Since it always went through ink so fast, and the printer no longer works, we are also not stuck with a bunch of ink cartridges we can't use.

The low rating isn't so much a reflection on the product as it is on the product's packaging. The manufacturer, Epson, knows that it has more than one type of Picturemate system on the market and that the cartridges are not compatible across all Picturemate models - yet the packaging does not state anywhere with which models the print pack is or isn't compatible.

Works fine as a Regular Phone
Just pick up the handset, press the buttons, and use normally. Speaker phone works great, easy to use. Volume can be turned up or down depending on the how loud the person you are talking to is speaking. Ringer on-off and volume can be set and changed very easily. Sound clarity is very good. I think its a great phone other than the features, which are not good at all.

Caller ID and Speed Dialing Problems!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1)LCD Very Dull and Dim
The Caller ID LCD can barely be seen!  It is washed out and dim, not at all as represented in the picture. When light shines on it, the shiny surface makes it even more difficult to see. More light washes it out even more! It can only be read at a certain angle.

2)Putting in a Number Manually
It's very difficult. Lets say you want to use one of those 10+10 services, so you enter a long series of numbers, and it doesn't work! Why? Because there is no option to add any pauses.

3)Editing a Number
How do you edit a number? You can't. You have-to start all over again.

4)How do you enter a persons name
Let's say you were to enter a name such as...MOM. When you hit the #6 Key the letter M appears, so far so good... now you press the #6 key rapidly and the M changes to the letter O, but that's a problem, because the name Mom starts with M and not O...so you wait for 2-seconds, and the cursor moves over one step to the right, and then you can enter the next character in the correct place, you hit the #6 key 3 or 4 times to get the letter O, now you wait 2-seconds again, and hit the #6 again to get M to spell the name MOM. Sounds complicated doesn't it? It is!!! But now you have to save it, how do you do that??? It's really tricky, you have to navigate to the right place, to select the correct menu option for saving.

5)How do you check a number for accuracy
If it's a long number such as 10+10+1+123+222+3456, you would press DIR and Arrow Up or CID and navigate to the correct name, and the number zooms by so fast, that if you blink, you will miss it. There is no way to see the whole number sequence, because it just won't fit on one line.

The microbeads filling the cushions are listed in 2 lines without mentioning these beads will likely be the reason you'll have to throw the desk away eventually. The cushions of all these type desks will wear eventually and when yours does, you'll realize what a terrible idea it is to fill anything with these microbeads.

This paper is made for SUBLIMATION INK ONLY, this is NOT going to work with you inkjet printer at all. I thought I would try anyway (to see if at least it could be used as normal paper) and the normal ink just bleeds all over it.

I had never heard about sublimation ink before, and after looking it up, it became clear I was not going to buy any equipment to be able to use this paper. It is pretty expensive. I might as well just buy the proper paper for my printer.

Anyway, I asked around and finally found somebody that owns a little sublimation printer. I learned that you can actually buy sublimation ink and fill refillable cartridges to convert your normal printer. So we met to try to print some design on shirts (this was my initial project). The paper comes in a clear plastic bag with a sticker on it that tells you which side to print on, so you better not remove it from there. It feels like normal paper, both sides looks the same. You also get instructions with the temperatures and pressing time you need for different materials. The instructions says the material of the shirts has to be 100% polyester or it won't stick to it (so no cotton).

We did not have a heat press, so we used an iron as directed. I do not know what went wrong, but it did not work. The design did not print very neatly, and when trying to transfer, some of it just did not stick to the shirt.

The last paragraph on the instructions says that you can not return the product. Again, I did not know what I was buying and I am not sure if I did something wrong, but it really did not work. I will use this paper to write on it, I guess. The quality is not very good and I was not impressed at all.

I bought the $75 printer in the hopes that it would last longer than all of the $25-$50 basic printers and well it's just like the rest short life span just more expensive...... so when it worked it was great and we are guilty of not using it too much so it's possible that the ink solidified in the head it's self but because of the design you can not get to it to clean it with a q-tip and alcohol.... GRRRRRR

This baby is fast, easy to install and prints well... I had enough with the color printers that would not let me print if the color cartridge ran out but I still had black ink so i never printed anything since the old printer i had took 6 cartridges just for color alone and it never failed when i would replace one .. with in a few days another would go so it was nearly $100.00 for a full run of color ink!!!!!! So Under $74.00 to the door for a high efficiency printer that is fast but still good is great!!!! the WIFI hookup was super easy. and it fold up the panels nicely so it does not take up as much space when it is not in use. i have not tried the print from phone feature yet but if I do I will put more feedback on here for everyone.

Great print quality, speed, and I loved the duplexing feature. Well, Last week (September 18 2014) a problem started where the paper started to crease and wrinkle when I tried the duplex printing option. I thought it might be the drum, so I replaced that but the creasing and wrinkling continued.  The printer works okay when it doesn't do the duplex printing. The creases/wrinkling occurs when the printer grabs the paper and prints on the second side.
I have  changed the drum, the cartridge, and the types of paper I use,but no solution. Today I sent Brother a leter outlining my problem with the creasing/wrinkling and hope they might have a solution. Unfortunately, with the one year warranty already expired by a few weeks, I don't know if I will have to pay to get it fixed. The printer cost me about 200.00 (a  year ago), so the odds are that the price of shipping/fixing wouldn't make economic sense. I would think a printer would last more than a year.

I had accumulated quote a bit of things to be shredded so as soon as I got this shredder I started shredding, a lot.

Safe Sense Technology
Although it I would be hard pressed to fit any finger through the opening of the shredder, even baby fingers, this sensor is a nice security feature. Basically, as soon as your fingers get to the area of the feeder, the shredder stops working. I guess this might be good for men and their ties...?

10 sheets
Well... It does shred the 10 sheets, slowly and grudgingly. I'd keep it at 6-7 to keep it working in top functioning order.

Fast
I was happy to see that the shredder works fast and efficiently. It does cut down on shredding time.

When that pen ran out, I bought a double pack but didn't use the pens right away.  I left them in my car and the temperatures dropped well below 0F on a number of occasions.  Once I finally used the pens, both wrote terribly.  The ink would only flow occasionally, clump up, write too thinly, or not write at all.  The results were terrible for both pens.  I foolishly believed the problem has been the pens had frozen.

I was wrong.

I purchased two new pens just last week.  They've never frozen (to my knowledge) and they're the same (with the exception of an improved erasure) to the pens I previously purchased.  The first I took out of the package writes terribly.  It skips, stops writing, clumps up or has an inconsistent ink flow.  At no time has this pen ever written anything I would think would even approach to what I would consider appropriate for a letter to someone you hate.

First issue was the yellow not registering, and I had to override it.  Not a huge deal.  but it was a huge deal that the yellow toner started leaking all over and left a gnarly yellow streak on every page.  I had to open it and clean it every page just to try and get through the print job I had to accomplish.

I asked seller to replace and they insisted I send the defective one back first.  Na, since I ordered it with PRIME, I just returned the whole thing for a refund and ordered another set for overnight, it seemed faster.

Next set, Cyan and Magenta Leak and the problem is so bad that I couldn't accomplish my print jobs period.

Take note that its not my printer causing this problem as the colors affected were opposites on each order.
Sadly, I have to return these too.  A lot of capital and time wasted.

The printer arrived and I could not get the foolish thing to install properly, after several attempts, (it's a Wireless Printer).  I finally called Lexmark's CS and allowed them access to my system, so they could install it for me.  Took some time, but it finally did install and was printing, when our call ended.  Later that same night, I went to make a copy of a document and realized that the copier and scanner did NOT work.  Called CS back and was told it was defective and that they would sent out another printer, (same model) but only it would be without any software or inks etc.  I tried to ask for a better one as this is NO where NEAR an upgrade and can be bought for as low as $99...!  It also prints lousy and user more ink than my other printer.  No at ALL happy !!

 I tried to ask for another model, as I knew this was not nearly the quality my former printer had been, but Lexmark refused.  I also asked for expedited shipment, which they also would not allow...even though I had no fault in receiving a defective printer?  After a full week, the second printer arrived and I immediately went to set it up and packed up the defective one to go back.  After four attempts and failure each time...the software continues to freeze, I could NOT install the silly thing and it took a full week for the second replacement to arrive.  Now that printer is also giving me grief and after spending another two hours on the phone with CS, neither of us could get it to install wirelessly.  So upset!  I could not stay on the phone any longer (neck killing by now) and had to give up, but it had been over 2 hours?  UGH!  The last suggestion was for me to download the install drivers instead to a laptop and TRY to install from a Laptop and then add it to my PC?  I thought about that, but it would be so much work and I am not convinced it would work, so I gave up?  I may try and call CS again and have them get this resolved...(or HOPE they will), but I'm so upset and frustrated that I don't even want this darn printer and will be shopping for another!

The first bad omen was when it wouldn't print because it kept saying the waste toner receptacle was full - after printing only 20 pages. I contacted tech support and they shipped me a new receptacle which worked fine. Then one of the cartridges ran out of ink - at around 150 or so pages and I couldn't print anything - definitely not good. Buyer's remorse really kicked in when I resarched replacement toner - there are no refill kits for these cartridges nor refurbished units. Even if I purchased the ""return program"" cartridges - where you basically promise to return the old cartridges to Lexmark - the high yield toner wound up costing more than what I paid for the printer - almost $300. Then the horror really set in - 400 to 500 pages later, I ran out of toner again. A sick empty feeling in my stomach hit me as I realized what a colossal mistake I made in buying this thing. It's been sitting in my basement for almost a year now as I decided to stop flushing so much money down the drain on toner and wait and see if the cartridge prices would come down or either a refill kit or refurbished cartridges would become available, but unfortunately, nothing.

Furthermore, Amazon is stating that I can't cancel or change my order, if I wanted to, so I could instead go out to a local store and buy the base, so I could get my phone system up and running. This would be good, but kind of defeats the whole purpose of buying online (to save time and the hassel of in-store shopping) and of paying for my yearly Amazon Prime fee (to save on delivery charges).

So, the reason for 1 star is really my beef with Amazon, not with the phone.  I'll seek to leave an update on the phone when I finally do receive it and can give it a thorough evaluation.",This phone seems promising but ...,1181779200,,

It's powered through the USB, which would be fine if it worked properly. I found myself have to unplug and plug it in several times before it would power up. Second: The unit is NOT Mac friendly. There is drivers and software for the Mac but the buttons on the unit will NOT work with Mac. Each scan must start with opening up the scan software. This brings me to the third issue: after each scan, the software closes and, since Mac users can not just push a button, you must go to Applications/Epson Software/Epson Scan for each and every page. Fourth: After clicking the scan button on the software, the unit runs through once to determine what kind of document is on the glass; then it just sits there until you click it again and then it will scan the document. So, for Mac users, you have to click on the software and click twice to get the scan; and this has to be done for each document. Last, but certainly not least: the scanned documents are not clear.

They call it ""save on ink"" what a joke!!!  At the time, I did not know that I would be replacing the ink once a WEEK.  I also didn't know that I would be replacing the color ink JUST AS MUCH and I have not printed ONE item in color.  This is what angers me.

If you happen to be a Mac user basically you are out of luck because Epson does not make a a version of this software for you.  2)  You can take your printer to an authorized Epson repair center and have them do over $200 worth of service on your print to try to get it back up and running.

First thing I noticed was that the part that holds the staples absolutely would NOT push all the way back in.  So I thought, well maybe it's supposed to hang out a little like that.  So I plugged it in to give it a try.  The light came on (and I'm still wondering what in the heck the light is needed for?) and I tried my first sheet of paper.  It went through the stapling sound but no staple appeared.  That's when I pulled the staple holder all the way out and realized it comes with lots of staples in the storage area but none placed in the row for actual stapling.  Unhindered, I simply filled that row with staples, closed it back up (only partway, remember - it still wouldn't close all the way) and tried again.  Only this time the light would NOT come back on.  Since the stapling ""sound"" didn't happen either, I can only assume the light is there, if for no other reason, then to tell you that the stapler is indeed on.

Since that initial try, the light has never turned on again.  Nor has the staple storage thing ever been able to recess all the way back in like I now know it SHOULD based on all the photos I looked up.

This is an absolutely horrible stapler.  I thought for sure I had gotten a ""lemon,"" but based on the number of 1-star reviews here, I can see that's not the case.  It's just a very poorly made stapler.  Which truly surprises me since let's face it, when you hear the name ""Bostitch,"" the FIRST thing that comes to most peoples' minds is staples, is it not?

After a couple web searches, I found a review here on Amazon that had been posted months ago stating that the computer setup program doesn't work.  You need to use your smartphone.  I did it on my iPad and it setup the scale just fine.

However, the total lack of response from customer support combined with the fact that they have a faulty setup program and don't appear to be doing ANYTHING to fix it...

I cannot recommend anyone buy anything from this company.  When you spend over a hundred USD to buy a bathroom scale, you expect it to work, and you expect that the company will want to help you if it doesn't.

Fitbit just doesn't seem to care.  So don't give them your money.

I give 4 stars for the scale, 4 stars for the web tracking service, and I take them all back for the non-existent support from Fitbit.",ZERO CUSTOMER SUPPORT,1391040000,10,

Previous review:
Easy to read. I've always loved the At-A-Glance calendars. The only reason I did not give five stars is because (maybe to save money on three sheets of paper?) they started each new month on the same page as the last with no break. This makes finding the new month a bit confusing but not nearly as bad as the binder refill I ordered last year. To say a product is not as bad as something else is not really a recommendation, but since I use a new paper calendar every year, I usually shop hands-on so I can see them. The makers have gotten so cheap-o, that I'd prefer an old fashioned wall calendar if they weren't so large because at least you get a new page for each month. Seriously, I am completely capable of knowing that if a month begins on a Wednesday, the last one must have ended on the Tuesday before it. Also, I wish this were punched to fit into my binder, but it is at least a nice comfortable size that will fit into a computer bag or larger purse.",NOT perfect. EDITED REVIEW,1409529600,,

a direct quote from Kodak customer support about why i HAVE to keep a working color cartridge in the printer:

""We apologise for the inconvinience you are facing with the printer. As you informed us that you are printing black and white but the color light keeps blinking. I would request you to please change the color ink as it is empty. We will not be able to print from the printer as it requires both the ink cartridges to be installed with ink in it. Printer need both the ink cartridges to print color or black and white.""

i'm now trying to figure out some way to ""trick"" the printer into thinking i have a full color cartridge.

in other printers i have used, i just told them to ignore the color cartridge or i pulled them out completely.

If you use your InkJet only occasionally for special printing then read on. I bought an Epson Workforce 610 in 2009. I always buy Epson Inks at Sams Club and never used other brands. I recently bought 4 High Capacity Epson InkJet Inks (68) from EpsonStore.com to replace 1 empty Magenta and a Black that was almost out and keep the rest as reserves. Once Magenta was installed, I did a regular Nozzle Check and as a result needed to do a Head Cleaning. I followed the directions in the manual (4X and wait 6 hours if problem persist and try again). During the first 4 tries, my black ran out. Assuming that I did not have much left on it in the first place I replaced it. Now I have 2 new, high-capacity inks in place. Problem was still there so I waited. The next morning, I tried printing again and did Nozzle check and Head cleaning for another 4 times. During this time again, the Yellow and Cyan went out! I was surprised because I still had it half-full at the beginning. So, I replaced them both and now have 4 new high-capacity inks installed at this time. At the end of the 8th try, the Black is half-empty, Magenta with 1/4 left, Cyan half-empty, and Yellow full. Through this I only have been printing Nozzle Check test prints. This prints are very light with very thin lines that should not even make a dent to the new ink cartridges. Now, where the heck did all my ink go? I called Epson Tech Support and got the tech-person to admit that the ink was going to an ""ink pad"" inside the printer. I was not even aware that there is an ink pad inside it. The manual states that it does use ink when doing Head Cleaning - (and not that much ink) and an ink pad was not mentioned there anywhere! If this is true, this ""ink pad"" must be really soaked with ink! I was advised to call EpsonStore and make a return. All this ink cost me $70 and so I demanded a refund. EpsonStore will not refund my money because items were already opened. I demanded at least to give me a new set of ink (4) so when I get my printer repaired (which I won't), I will have some ink to use. They called corporate and gave me an exemption and new inks will be sent. This printer is going straight to the garbage. Those inks (when they get here) is going straight to eBay.

I bought two others before they started doing this and the last one I bought I ported my home phone to the magic jack. I was charged $20 for porting the number and little did I know, they charge a porting fee every time you pay for additional years. So when I was offered the option to pay their yearly fee plus a porting fee to renew my service I declined.

Next, I started a new cell phone service and tried to port my number from magic jack to my new cell phone. To my surprise magic jack would not allow the port unless I paid a ransom of $30. I did pay it because I wanted my old number back. No other phone company that I have used have charged a porting out fee and it might be illegal. I filed a complaint with the FCC but have not heard back from them yet.

If you want to work with a quality marker for art purposes that you'd like to be more permanent and flexible when mixing media, buy another brand!

For most folks, this may be an insignificant difference, but in my case I was covering an area on the wall that needed to be at least 35 inches high. So unfortunately, I had to improvise.

In fairness on another issue, some reviewers question why the manufacturer does not pre-drill the holes on the board for installation. In actuality, having the installer drill the holes provides for greater flexibility in the installation process (for example, if a hole you drilled in a concrete classroom wall was off by a tiny amount, the holes on the board can be adjusted accordingly).

First, let's get the pros out of the way. The Jetstream 0.38 is a very fine point ballpoint pen, and it does write a very fine line. It's only slightly thicker than a Hi-Tec-C 0.3. The ink is supposed to be water resistant, unlike a lot of gel ink pens, so that may be a reason to choose them. The point is conical and robust, and not a fragile-looking needlepoint like a Hi-Tec-C. It should work well on multi-part forms. The body is pretty solid, definitely better than a Signo RT1, though not as good as a good capped pen like a Signo DX.

Now, for the cons. While they dry relatively fast, they do blob a bit (their fine point means they don't blob as bad as a broader point ballpoint does), and they do smear some due to the blobbing. Of the three pens I got, both the blue and the black ones exhibit starting problems (skipping when you start to write) and intermittent skipping problems, sometimes bad enough that they won't write again until you scribble some. The red one was much better, with no starting problems and minimal skipping, though. They're no more available than good gel pens, and only slightly cheaper.

Overall, they aren't bad pens per se, and as ballpoints they do have the occasional strength over gel pens, but for me at least, their drawbacks don't put them ahead of a good fine point gel pen, like the Signos, Hi-Tec-Cs/G-Tec-Cs, or Sliccis, so I can't recommend them at all.","Probably good for a ballpoint, but still a ballpoint",1479945600,3,

I set this up with an iPhone and it took around 5 minutes. Sure, it's a little convoluted, but I followed the instructions exactly and it was easy and successful. I first tested it on a carpet.

On a positive note, this seems like a great design for a light duty inkjet printer.  Only time will tell if the ink works long term though.  Previous inkjet printers constantly were having quality issues and needed cartridges replaced frequently.

I like the little color display, much nicer than a boring B&W LCD screen.

I give Epson kudos for having a decent system for entering your wireless password without an actual keyboard, this is much easier than previous designs I've used.

Set up was fairly easy.  I really like the design for the ink, but beware this approach does mean that it is fairly easy to spill ink on your fingers.  Print quality seems typical of an inkjet.

Beware: it only works on a wireless network that supports 2.4GHz (which I assume almost all do) (or you could use a USB cable)  I still think Epson should include a hard wired network port for those that don't want to use wireless (but want it further away than a USB cable would work).

If you are used to having a personal scanner, this is really nice to have a networked scanner for light duty usage by all computers in the house.

Update: The printer worked nicely for several months.  But when/if it loses power it seems to lose the WiFi connection (which is a royal annoyance if your password is secure and hard to type).  Now I can't get it to connect at all (even though the network status sheet prints out that everything is fine and connected).  So I'm stuck with a printer that reports that it can't connect (""Communications Error"") and nothing seems to help.

People on the other end can barely hear my voice.  Range is improved a bit if you use a wired headphone, but that is a bit of a pain to do.

I tried using it at a local bookstore, but their wireless system requires a web browser in order to sign in and pay, which this phone does not support. So, not much use unless you are close to a router and have the security code for it.

As a phone to replace a wired or wireless setup, this does not make the grade for me.  I subsequently bought the similar IPEVO phone, the IPEVO has a bit better range, and people can hear at the remote end better, but they complain of an echo where they hear their voice again.

I liked what I saw and was about to order them when I noticed a link for these ""Design-R-Line Poly Envelope With Front Pocket"". The price was even cheaper than the Smead, and it employs a hook and loop closure mechanism instead of string like on the Smead. There wasn't much of a product description, so using the picture of 5 MULTI -COLORED envelopes as a guide, I took the risk of buying two. (I was expecting get 10 envelopes.)

Much to my chagrin, today I received 2 CLEAR envelopes. I thought there was some mistake until I logged back onto Amazon's website and noticed in the product title that there is nothing about a pack of 5 MULTI -COLORED envelopes (like in the picture). I guess it's my inexperience and naivet&eacute; that led me to believe that a picture of 5 MULTI -COLORED envelopes was an actual representation of the product I could expect. I've now come to realize that it is merely an artistic representation of a single clear-colored envelope. While disappointed, I am appreciative of having a new perspective on artistic marketing which should help me in the future. For example, the next time I book a flight on an airline to Japan I will not assume that it will be a on a jumbo-jet; nor will I assume I am going to Japan. Instead, I will know that the flight will be on a Cessna 172 or some equivalent, and while I may not make it to Japan, I will end up somewhere in Asia. Thank you Amazon.com and ReStockIt for enlightening me! I feel we have both grown so much from this experience.

Now onto what I think about each of the SINGLE CLEAR envelopes I did receive. They seem to be made of a durable poly material. The fold over cover only secures the items in one pocket. The other pocket is the same dimensions, but items can fall out of it. The envelopes are not expandable so you can only get a few standard (8.5"" X 11"") sheets of paper in each.

I give this product two stars because it isn't completely terrible, but because of the deceptive marketing employed it deserves no more. On a final note, I WILL NOT be purchasing any more of these items and will instead get some of the aforementioned Smead envelopes.

I'd also purchased an ink converter, so I know it's not the cartridge, as I've tried about a half dozen different inks.  With each, even if I leave the pen for an hour, it dries and I must either prime the converter or dip the nib into water or ink.  I was embarrassed at a meeting when the pen would not write and  I needed to sign a document.  Visually, this pen is five star.  In the hand, it's also five star.  If it worked properly, it would be a total five star value.  Unfortunately, a pen that doesn't write is worthless unless you've purchased it for another purpose.  I purchase pens to use as a tool for transporting ink to paper, so this one is a great disappointment.

The first peripheral I was not able to get installed on Linux (sometimes things are tough, I admit.)

I have four networked Linux PCs in my home with a wireless Brother multifunction printer. I wanted a standby printer to connect via USB for those emergencies where the networked printer doesn't work. Brother had been known for supporting Linux so i gave this ML-L2350 a shot. It simply doesn't work. It is recognized by Linux, and Linux believes jobs get sent and completed, but the printer doesn't even wake up. The downloads page on the Brother website has (1) an automated driver install tool, (2) model-specific lpd and CUPS drivers, and (3) generic lpd and CUPS drivers. None work. They come with strange and simply wrong instructions. Other people on the web were able to get this printer to work under Linux with much grief using the generic drivers; I was not successful even following their clear instructions (which, again, are opposed to the instructions on the Brother site).

I plugged in a Windows 10 laptop. It was recognized right away and the printer driver was installed in 60 seconds. Printed text in several fonts and sizes and a grayscale photo perfectly. Impressive, actually.

There are no LED lights so you don't know if the printer is awake or not. The 12-character LCD (yes, LCD) display is countersunk into the cover making it difficult to read even head-on without a flashlight. The buttons are spongy like a dollar-store calculator.

I gave this thing two stars because it worked under Windows. It would get zero stars if rated on meeting MY NEEDS.

2.0,True,"07 4, 2015",A26X7W5UM5QFT4,B00004Z5WK,,Grits,"Both cartridges were apparently over-filled (I thought), and would not feed the tape to print it.  The machine could not pull the tape out of the cartridge for some reason.  Eventually, after tugging gently on the tape, I figured there was nothing to lose, so I grabbed and pulled very hard.  Finally, the tape barely began to be pulled from the inside, and after I'd wasted a foot of tape (a full 10% of the entire roll), it was loose enough that the machine could feed it properly.  After that, printing was fine.

When I inspected the cartridges more closely, I saw that the inside of the cartridge is fairly visible from one side, and there is clearly a huge amount of empty space on the inside of the tape area, so it's not a matter of being over-filled.  These are only 10 foot tapes, whereas I  currently have a 23 foot black-on-white cartridge that has exactly the same amount of space inside the cartridge for tape.  With the much longer tape, it simply winds further inside the empty space, leaving less space in the middle of the circular area containing the remaining tape.  For whatever reason, these two cartridges have the tape very tightly pushed up against the outside edge of the circular area containing the tape supply, and the inside end of the tape isn't loosely unwinding itself into the middle to give the tape some slack (like it does with the 23 foot long cartridge).

Bottom line: if you have the same problem of the machine trying to print but nothing comes out, grab the colored portion (not the black character tape underneath it in the cartridge) and pull it as hard as you have to, to get it started.  Once you've pulled it far enough to be able to feel that it's feeding fairly easily, try re-installing the cartridge and it will probably work fine.  It's just sad to have to waste 10% of the entire supply on both cartridges in this package.

ADDED: As a Vine reviewer, I do not see the selling price, and hadn't gone to look at that before the review.  Before this edit, I had rated this a 3-star product because of the wasted tape due to the apparent internal defect in both cartridges.  I have now downgraded it to a 2-star rating after seeing the price.  I already own one of these Dymo label makers, and recently ordered a black-on-white cartridge that is 23 feet long (more than the combined total of these two cartridges).  As with prior cartridges, there were no problems with the tape feeding, unlike these two shorter (10' ""Neon"" cartridges).  Yet the price of the 23' tape is only 54% of these two 10' tapes (20' combined).  There's no way that more than twice as much tape should be half the price of a double-pack of the same tape just because they're using different colors in the plastic.  Yes, the two cartridges cost pennies more than one cartridge package, but they're selling in bulk, thus saving costs there on packaging.

Worse, I just recently ordered (and received) a replacement 23' cartridge because the old one was getting close to empty.  After doing the initial review of this Vine product, I decided to see if it feeds OK.  It does not!  It too had to be pulled out of the cartridge, though not as far as the 10' cartridges, before it would feed automatically during printing.  It appears that Dymo has a manufacturing problem that goes well beyond these new little 10' ""neon"" cartridges.  The problem is now also in the old standard 23' cartridges as well - a fundamental manufacturing issue.","EDITED: Had to waste 10% of both cartridges just to get it to feed - it's a more widespread problem, too - see review",1435968000,,

Many parts fit poorly which leads to a very wobbly stand which makes typing on one's laptop difficult.  The knobs for tightening are too flimsy for the task which leaves the two surfaces vulnerable to tipping.  The device raises and lowers by depressing a stop and sliding the device to the next position, sort of like a manual umbrella where one shaft sits inside another and one pulls the shafts apart till a stop engages.  The stop, however, is a simple piece of springy metal that is bent and inserted into the shaft - it is not held in place by any guides or fasteners and be easily lost in the shaft.  The stop often does not protrude sufficiently to hold the weight and the metal, after several pushes, needs to be re-bent to be ""springy"" again.  Even the cheapest umbrella is better designed.  The lowest position is also probably too high for many who want to sit at the stand.  Also, the two surfaces, though they can tilted independently, cannot be set to different heights.

Update 10/15/15: I must admit to being quite hasty in my initial review of Helianthus, which I wrote after three days of use. I am revising the review from its original 4 stars down to 2, due to the gross thickening of this ink.

I am attaching a picture in addition to the original picture to show exactly what I am talking about. The top pen is a Lamy Vista, Medium, in which I have been using Faber-Castell Moss Green ink for the same amount of time as I have used the Rohrer & Klingner Helianthus in a Lamy Safari, Medium. These two pens are identical, yet the Safari with it's Rohrer & Klingner ink is just filthy with clotted, gross ink all over the nib. I have used both pens equally, writing alternate days with each. Never have I seen an ink do this, and it is not old, contaminated, or improperly handled.

With so many inks out there to choose from, I have to say this experience greatly lessens the chance I will purchase any other ink by Rohrer & Klingner.","Beautiful Sunshine Color, Gross Performance.",1438300800,2,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61c4CkYKphL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711mZJrtawL._SY88.jpg']"

I'm not impressed with this clipboard. Here's why:
1. The clips on the compartments are plastic that is molded right with the rest of the clipboard.  Not nice hinge clip like other boards.  It's VERY hard to open either compartment, almost impossible with one hand.  You have to bend the plastic clip out and over the stub and it is very uncomfortable.
2.  The plastic is thinner and not as strong as other brands like Dexas or Sandurs.  These are thicker and more heavy duty, but not necessarily haiver.

I DO NOT recommend this product at all.

One storage clipboard I own and like is the ""Dexas Clipcase 2"" which I got at Walmart for only $6 (a standard there).  It's not sold on amazon, but they have the original ""Clipcase""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dexas-Slimcase-Black/dp/B007CE6SOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dexas Slimcase , Black</a>
The only difference is that the ""Clipcase 2"" has the hinge clip on the right side and opens like a book, and the original ""Clipcase"" has the hinge clip on the bottom and opens up.  I prefer the hinge on the side as it is easier to open, and I can do it with one hand while holding the clipboard with the other.

The Dexas ""Clipcases"" don't have special pen compartments, it's just one big compartment.  I actually like this better, it's just another step to get your pen out of another compartment, and I never had any issues having the pen in the main compartment.

If you like having an extra compartments, consider the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dexas-School-Clipcase-Purple/dp/B009649T1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dexas School Clipcase, Purple</a>&nbsp;in translucent colors or solid black.

Pouches: there is no clear plastic wrapper to allow one to insert a front cover, rear cover, or full-height spine label. There is a roughly 2"" high by 1"" wide pocket on the spine for a small label. Inside there are two pouches, one each inside the front and rear covers.

Rings: The binder has a 3-ring mechanism. the rings appear to be spaced the same as any normal letter-size binder and are centered vertically along the spine of the binder. They are round (not the better ""D""-shaped) rings and there are no levers to open them. You just have to pull them apart with your fingers. (I like the one-touch binders, but perhaps I'm spoiled.)

Size: This is the truly fatal flaw, in my opinion. The binder is tall enough at about 14.5 inches, but it is not deep enough (about 9.25 inches from the center of the rings to the edge of the binder). The outside edge of Avery Legal Size (8x14"") Heavyweight Sheet Protectors (p/n 73897) will not be protected properly by this binder! By my most optimistic measuring, the front cover is at most 10 inches wide. The sheet protectors are about 9.25"". Seems like it should be ok but it just isn't.  About 1/8"" to 1/4"" of the sheet protector projects past the edge of the binder. You can push the protectors back and they will just fit inside the edge of the binder but they won't stay there when you release them and clearly they are not being properly protected. I notice that the competing Cardinal brand 2"" binder gives product dimensions of 14.1 x 11.3 x 0.9 inches, has slant-D rings and the photo shows it with one page-lifter though the description doesn't specify if that comes with it or not. On the other hand, it is almost $32 while this Avery binder was only about $12.

If I knew then what I know now, I'd have ordered the Cardinal binder instead of Avery. Sometimes you just have to pay the price if you want a good product. On the other hand, if you don't care about the edges of your documents, the Avery binder may be a bargain for you.

 My grandson came over and did some 'test' prints to see if he wanted this type of printer but after making multiple copies with a lot of noticeable changes on the computer, the printed copies all had the same faded look to them. I do not think we are being too picky!!
 Maybe this is because its the first images printed. They pass for tossing some pictures on a refrigerator but not to frame them.

To connect the printer to the wireless network I had to create an HP account, setup the subscription for the automated ink and have the printer connect to HP servers before being able to use the printer. For their new ink system we will see how it goes with printing pictures. The prices appear reasonable especially for the amount of ink used for printing photos.

* Upon opening, you will discover the paper storage is not enclosed in a tray.  In fact, there is no paper tray, just a slot to slide the paper into after the front panel is lowered.  The paper then pokes out the front of the printer to collect dust.  Eventually, the dust travelling on the paper into the printer will likely affect paper feed and print quality.  Also, the front of the printer must remain open while there is paper inserted in the printer.

* The footprint of the printer, even without paper inserted and the front panel opened, is large.  Similar sized printers have concealed paper trays.

* The display is two line and, more importantly, not backlit.

* The menus on the display are not intuitive to navigate

* Setting up Wi-Fi via the display proved to be unfriendly and time consuming given there were absolutely no printed directions.  I gave up and elected to do it after the software installation via the software interface like the quick start instructions suggested.  So, I chose USB during install - thinking I could then configure wireless.  Wrong choice (see below).

* After installation - I had EIGHT new icons on my desktop without any choice during installation.

* Once the printer installed via USB, I could not connect using Wi-Fi.  The program the user manual states to launch to configure wireless - the ""IJ Network"" utility - had not been installed.

* No printed directions were included for information as fundamental as describing what the pretty little pictures on the unlabeled buttons on the front of the printer mean.

* The biggest deal breaker is the lack of choice on which drive 400 PLUS megabytes of software installs itself.  I kept expecting the installation wizard to give me a choice but instead it started installing all of the software to the C drive with no ability to cancel the process.

I installed this printer on a fast gaming rig with a solid state boot drive I keep clean from excess software.  I have a huge secondary drive onto which I install programs such as these from Canon.  I resent that the Canon programs and utilities automatically installed to my boot drive thus taking up quite a bit of valuable real-estate on my SSD.  I really, really resent having to now explore how to uninstall all of these Canon utilities and reinstall the software I was using for my other Canon printer onto the correct drive.  I have installed many printers - including other Canon printers.  I build my own PCs.  I have worked as a network administrator in the past.  I have a bit of tech knowhow.  But I am truly annoyed at the amount of time and effort a simple printer install has taken - and I am not finished yet.

For a wireless printer in my upstairs work area, I recently installed an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Epson-WorkForce-630-Color-Inkjet-All-in-One-C11CB07201/dp/B003XDU8P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Epson WorkForce 630 Color Inkjet All-in-One (C11CB07201)</a>&nbsp;with more features, a more solid build, a smaller foot print, a real paper tray and separate ink tanks for color printing - all for about the same price as this Canon.  The Epson also has a memory card reader and faster print speeds.  The Epson install was not without a hiccup but was much easier than the MX 432 has turned out to be.

On the plus side, the quality of the printing and scanning on the MX 432 are good.  Nothing ""OMG its great"" but adequate and what is expected at the price point.  The software interface is good and with a similar feel to previous Canon releases for their multi-function units.  Another plus, the new software seems to work fine with my older MP 830, which will remain my main printer.

Overall, I would pick the Epson Workforce 630 hands down over the Canon MX 432 for this price range.  I hate to pan the printer; I still love and use my Canon MP830.  But this model is a definite ""pass.""",There are better options than the MX 432,1333152000,71,

If you aren't familiar with Pantum printers, the W at the end of the model number means ""Wifi."" I would reccomend the 2502NW which is Ethernet and wifi. I'm not particularly sure why the non-ethernet model exists, except to annoy owners who think that they are getting a proper network connected printer, only to realize that its only half of one.

The wifi itself is a little clunky because this is a very basic printer. Everything is done via the installer app. There is no ""print service"" application that runs in the tray, nor is there a panel on the printer to handle network configuration, or any other settings. If you unplug the printer, you will need to re-install the drivers on EVERY computer in your house (or switch to static IP's via your router whichever is less of a headache.)

Pantum, as a brand, uses chips. These chips haven't been successfully duped or reset by the after-market, so you will be stuck paying full price for toner. I paid $30 for the printer, and I pay $60 for toner. These chips WILL kill your print cartridge before you are out of toner. I average around 1400-1600 light coverage pages, which is less than the advertised 1700 pages it supposedly covers, and I know for a fact that there is at least some capacity to print beyond where the chip says there is... whether that is 20 pages worth of toner vs 200 pages, I don't know. For those of you playing at home with a calculator, that's an incremental cost of 4 cents a page +/- .2 cents (not including the cost of paper.) That's not actually terrible.

I have never had the printer overheat, or stop to rest during a ""big"" job (200+ pages). I have never personally had the paper jam on me, but my GF had it happen to her. Clearing the jam was not difficult, but it seems like it could have been. The internals are very stiff and don't move freely. Had the paper torn inside the printer, there is no clear way to evacuate the rollers or gain access to parts of the machine. One time I had a document print a header image with weird blank spaces that could have been caused by the print drivers or the web application I was using at the time.

Some amount of the time, I'd say roughly 10% of the time, when it prints, there is a chance that it will arbitrarily spit pages out onto the floor, if you aren't watching. The paper tray is too small.

The biggest issues I've had are 1) one of the computers on my network being poorly configured somehow causing the printer to have trouble connecting to the wifi and 2) printer cartriges giving out early.

All that aside, WHEN this thing works, it works pretty well. It prints clearly, though it doesn't do amazing with small details. It's slow, it takes about 4 seconds to print a page. As I've said, not many issues with paper-jams or un-expected time-outs. It WILL print out 1000 pages as readily as it prints out 1 page. When it's setup, it wakes, prints and goes back to sleep seemlessly, and toner price is competitive, IF you are used to paying full price to HP or brother. There will be no $20 refills at cartridge world though.","Not exactly a workhorse, and there have been issues.",1505088000,,

I use a large amount of Avery products for organizing and labeling, both at work and at home.  When I first got these pocket-tabs, I thought I had solved a huge need.  The versatility of storing papers, cards, or disks in these pockets was exactly what I was looking for.  Being able to label the tabs seemed even better.  But after using these for a few months, I think that the cons outweigh the pros.

PROS
+ The mix of features are perfect for those who have mixed storage needs
+ The 5 pack size is good for those who only need a few pockets; many binder sheets are sold in packs of 25
+ The color options allow for easier coding / classification of pockets
+ The adhesive backing allows pockets to be moved (although that also makes them adhere weakly to many surfaces)
+ The colored pockets are see-through, allowing you to read notes stored inside
+ The pockets close, unlike many binder sleeves made solely for CDs and DVDs
+ After months of use, the plastic seams have stood up well

CONS
-- The pockets are too small to include a padded sleeve to provide extra protection to CDs or DVDs
-- The lack of integrated padding makes this inferior to most binder sleeves for CD or DVD storage
-- The cutout used to keep the pocket closed feels easy to break and is awkward to slip open and closed
-- The tabs can be written on once instead of being designed to work with printed Avery tab inserts; you are out of luck if you want to change what you wrote
-- The tabs can only be written on the front side; the backside is smooth plastic; this is impractical when they are turned
-- The weight of the pocket is too heavy to be reliably attached to sheets of paper
-- The adhesive backing is too weak to really hold them securely to many surfaces
-- The adhesive will indeed sometimes lift paper and ink when repositioned
-- The lack of holes for use in a 2 or 3 ring binder is a big missing feature

On the package, it advises that the adhesive should ""always be tested"" to ensure that it will not pull paper and ink when the pockets are moved.  However, even on areas that passed this test, I found that paper and ink sometimes came up after the pockets had been adhered to one place for two long.  Maybe changing temperatures made some paper weaker than others.  I stopped sticking these to paper and now adhere these pockets directly to my binder covers instead.  Some tape in the corners helps to keep them secure because the adhesive alone is not enough to keep them in place.

Because of the weaknesses for storing CDs and DVDs, I have also devoted these to small papers.  Other products that are designed for CDs and DVDs are probably best for that purpose.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caselogic-CDP-200-200-Disc-Capacity-CD-ProSleeve-Pages/dp/B000KMR2YK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caselogic CDP-200 200 Disc Capacity CD ProSleeve Pages</a>&nbsp;are great for storing CDs in 3-ring binders, but they do not close and are not an option for disks and cards.  That works out to a much better value but it does require you to purchase many more (25) sleeves, with each one holding 8 disks as opposed to one.  Other options are available such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fellowes-CD-ROM-Loose-Leaf-Binder-Sheets/dp/B00006IC6R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fellowes CD-ROM Loose-Leaf Binder Sheets</a>&nbsp;but I haven't tried those yet.

CONCLUSION

This product may work for you if you just need something to store small cards or loose papers.  This is not a good solution if CDs are your primary storage need.

I started using it about 2 months ago and for the first few weeks when it got very light use it was great. I figured it wouldn't take 16 pages but this is ridiculous. It will take 10 sheets of standard 20wt office type copy paper, not exactly out-of-the-ordinary for a home office and at 12 sheets it stops and flashes ""overload.""
As I write this I can only feed it paper if I fold it in half and put it in the middle of the feed in slot because the outside edge of the grinder has a build up/jam of paper. I am trying to figure out how to un-jam it so I can go back to full sheet shredding. And yes, I have used the shredder lubricant.
I knew how much paper I would have to shred on a monthly basis and I purposely bought a shredder that was advertised as being capable of shredding twice that much. As it turns out because I recycle all paper(I use both sides) I have a much smaller amount to shred and it is a GOOD thing. When you have to fold all the sheets lengthwise and feed them in at 4 or 5 at a time it takes a LONG time to shred those medical records.

Secondly, every time I try to place a piece of paper in the rear loader, it tries loading the paper, makes all sort of adjustments to the paper, then inevitably gives me an error message, saying ""printing is cancelled because paper was inclined while loading.""

However, the least expensive ink here at Amazon was $21.56 for the double black, and for some reason is now, after I placed my most recent order, is not available.

I am an artist/architect and I run prints of my work for testing purposes to see how they print. In the last 18 months I have spent hundreds of dollars on inks which seem to be eaten by the printer almost as fast as we fill them. I have some commitments until summer and then we have decided to sell or donate the Epson Workforce 615 printer. It came with my newest MAC, so the printer cost was nil. I got along fine without the color printer in the past and will again.

Paint is relatively inexpensive, so there is no reason why Powdered colors should be in the realm of gasoline. The actual price of a gallon of gasoline is no greater than it was 40 years ago because its production is completely automated/computer produced. The profit margin on gasoline is now about 1300%. Oil companies  have made $2.3 trillion since 2002. In Venezuela gas is 12 cents a gallon at the pump and in Mexico it is chump change per gallon, here it is from $4.75-$5.04 a gallon for gas that costs pennies to produce, so we sold our two cars, installed Geothermal HVAC with a metal roof on our house and now we have ZIP energy costs. We will no longer use printers until the profit margin drops or they create a system in which the packets of ink/toner last 10 times as long as they do now.

5. Driver/software.  Controlling printer preferences is not so easy, even for things like printing 1/2 sided or output quality, it took a lot of digging around/drilling to get into the settings I needed.  Even then, often they were greyed out and could not be altered.  What gives?

Sounded very good given the monthly amounts we were paying to our landline provider.  Our main complaint is for incoming calls.  Sometimes it would tell callers that the number was not in service.  Other times the phone would just ring and not answer.  A day ago everything would not work including any wifi device.  At first I thought it was our equipment or server.  After a little troubleshooting, I thought it might be Ooma since the dsl goes from the modem to Ooma then to the router.  6 hours later we were concerned that no one could communicate with us since our network was down.  I disconnected all the cables and reset everything leaving Ooma our of the loop.  All came back on line.  Yes, Ooma is probably the best bang for the buck.  However, we need to receive incoming communications.  We have spotty cell phone reception and sometimes our cell phone providers don't forward our voice mails as soon as they are received.  Well, we just don't want to take a chance on equipment or services that are not reliable.  Now we have to either go back to the landline or get another cellphone setup such as femtocell.

The printer for me was very cheap. I got it on sale at a local store for the price of an ink cartridge! I knew what was coming since I know printer companies generally like to make their money off of ink cartridges.

The photo printing quality is excellent for the price as long as you get good paper. I've used some thinner cheap paper and it just did not look as good. The quality when using the ""Standard"" setting is not that good, so I found myself needing to use the ""High"" setting.

My main issue with this printer is that it uses so much ink that it almost seems like robbery. There is absolutely no way one color ink cartridge could print more then a  dozen full color images on the ""High"" setting on regular sized photo paper. So it's as if you're paying one and a half dollars per photo! I think the main problem is that the cartridge has several color tanks inside it. Once one is empty you are required to buy a new cartridge. I'm not sure if this is how this model works, but I think so.

It's really hard to complain since the cartridges are cheap and the printer is cheap. It's still a better deal then the last printer brand i've used (starts with a K and ends with a K).

If you don't mind paying around $20 for 12-15 full sized photos, since it's not such a bad deal.

The primary reason i'm knocking off several stars is that the printer constantly gives me a service error when the ink is low. I need to unplug the cable and plug it back in.",Waste of Ink,1267488000,,

The hard cover. . . the elastic band. . .  the cloth bookmark. . .  the ivory paper. . .  the rounded corners. . .  It's all good.  I might quibble that the ruled lines are spaced a bit narrowly for my handwriting.  It's good with a EF nib pen, and it fits a few more lines on each page, but it's a wee bit cramped compared with my normal handwriting.

What really ruins it for me is the paper quality.  I've heard it varies from one batch to the next, and it sure seems like I got one of the bad ones.  I found many combinations of fountain pens and ink are prone to ugly feathering and bleeding in it.  With many of them it's impractical to write on both sides of the sheet, which basically cuts the notebook in half from what it should be.  TO BE FAIR, I found I could tame it by choosing the right ink (Noodlers Black) and using a not-too-wet fountain pen.  Indeed, I would be willing to take this extra effort to adapt to this notebook's quirks if there were no better alternatives out there.

Recently, though, other companies such as Quo Vadis and Rhodia have come up with their own moleskine-style notebooks featuring high-quality paper.  They cost a bit more, but I figure this type of notebook is a premium product to begin with.  In the future I'll give Moleskine a miss and spend a little more for a better notebook.

While I would love to give this machine a glowing review it has been one headache after another. Customer service is pretty worthless. I'm past the 1 yr limited (very very limited) warranty. The magenta has given me issues since I first bought this machine. I'm not sure if it's something to do with the ink that just gums up the print head or something else. I do a fair amount of colored printing and much more black printing. This is one of those machines that uses all the dang colors even when printing black only pages. It drinks up the magenta more than anything. I've replaced just the magenta 4x as many times as the other colors. It's insane. Tonight one of the prongs broke (that reads the chip on the cartridges) in the magenta slot while I was trying to replace it yet again. Now the dang machine will not acknowledge the magenta. I'm not rough and never force anything with this machine or any other. I'm always afraid of breaking something. Even with a gentle hand this thing broke. I'm willing to guess its been loose or faulty long before the break tonight since there has been a lot of issues with that color.

 I bought this printer for the large format scanner and printing but it would give me a low ink error midway thru printing anything larger than 8.5x11. I would have to check the ink just to see that there were none low or out.  Then scrap the half printed piece and try again. It wasted a lot of paper and ink in the time that I've owned it. Pretty sure this will be the last Epson printer I ever own. Aside from one I owned in 2000 every printer since then has been rubbish.
 The wireless part did work well. It setup quickly and easily. Even after keeping it unplugged for a week during the last hurricane it connected as soon as it was plugged back in. If you have a slow connection I do not recommend the wireless. It will alter your prints color, saturation, and create errors.
 Constant banding no matter how many times the print heads were cleaned. I ran all the diagnostics and it was never enough to get this thing to print more than 2-3 pages cleanly after the first month of using it.

2.0,True,"07 4, 2017",A1W5NAAE1ERLP0,B005UNFXNG,,P. Larsen,"This is a revision to my initial review. This printer is EXPENSIVE to run, and has slowly had more and more issues. It started out as a recommended printer by the consumer report who'd calculated a per page price that was better than anything I've seen. Unfortunately, reality for me is quite the opposite. A cartridge doesn't even cover 500 pages, let alone 2000. And if you try to buy non Lexmark ink, you run into other problems. It's a closed format, as we the consumers have to pay the price of a complete new printer every time we ""refill"" the ink. On this area alone, I would NOT recommend going with the officeedge - it's much too expensive in day-to-day use.

My family we've found we print less and less. Documents are sent to mobile devices if they're needed. Scans are done by taking a picture with your phone and if needed, OCR'ed on the computer. FAX - I haven't faxed since the late 1980ies ... never used the feature, have no clue who would EVER need that. For this reason, we wanted a printer for occasional use. When we purchased it, we wanted to be able to print nice photos - that's proven to be a goosehunt - I haven't printed pictures since we bought it. It's cheaper to have CVS print them (see above). My goal was simple: Competivie per page prints at a good resolution.

Installation: I'm a Linux user, but for a while we did have a Windows computer. The installation on it was more than an hour. Linux was done in a few minutes, and  Linux doesn't come with all the junk and spam software Lexmark forces on you.  Scanning is another thing all together. Here's the gist of the issue: Unless the printer is on the same subnet as your comptuer, forget it (no, this is not documented). It's a very very strange system where the computer must host the printer's scan. I suspect the Lexmark software for OCR etc. is not present on the printer, so hence they need post-processing done on the PC. You start a print by creating a ""profile"" which your scan software is supposed to see (when configured right), then you tell your PC to accept the scan. So depending on how you see it, it's a 2-3 step process. And since we have more than one computer here, I am in the basement wanting to scan something on a printer that's upstairs. Crazy. You cannot even scan to a SDCARD.  This is one of the functions that were hard to get working, but eventually stopped working. Why? Because Lexmark requires Java on the browser to set the profile. The world no longer accepts this, and no major browser can load Java Applets anymore. So this function is becausically defaulted - if you need to scan using the printer, you're out of luck. Don't go this way.  Once or twice we did manage to mange scanning of several pages work, which is a nice feature - once you've pushed a thousand keys and walked a thousand steps. It would have been a lot faster just using my phone.

Did I already say that FAX makes no sense? A ton of the buttons and function in the menu is dedicated to the ""fax"" feature. Why?? Why would EVER need a fax?

The printer does have some nice feature - double sided printing is definitely one of them.

So what happened? Well, the ink is the problem. Not only is it extremely pricy, doesn't last long. And it doesn't last long because there's a lot of problems with the ink, and you have to continuously ""clean heads"" which seems to consume A LOT of ink. You don't get consistent quality prints, and we just got to the point where trying to waste more ink of another round of ""clean heads"" made no sense. That, and the printer refusing to print one color, big stripes and breaks in the print etc.  Black/white prints were ok but that's about it.

I looked around and I can get a full printer (scanner + printer) for LESS than what buying ink for this is costing me. So that's what we did. So my advice is to ignore the pages-per-cartridge number here, and wise up. Yes, it's a fairly fast ink yet print - but if you're like us and only print once or twice a month, does that really matter?

The problem is that the Mac OS driver works only with Photoshop and NOT ANY OTHER program I tried, including standard Image Capture and TWAIN applications. What's worse, this scanner does not work with VueScan on Mac OS X and its developer Ed Hamrick confirmed this. I've also tried this scanner and a range of softwares on Leopard and Snow Leopard with no luck except for recent versions of Photoshop.

Using Photoshop, this scanner gives very slow scans and very lousy image quality. Documents and line drawings in color will show fuzzy rainbow edges. The image quality may be acceptable for low quality document uses, but the scanner is way too slow for that application.

In short, it is nice to have an option for tabloid scanner in this price range, but the usability of this product is quite limited.

2.0,True,"02 19, 2014",A1RJUXDK64O91A,B00EANURCE,{'Style:': ' Printer'},Sandy P,"Update: I had to come back and revise this review. Everything I said previously is true, and I adored this printer, while it lasted. I bought this in mid-late 2014, and it's already having major problems. The most recent is that printing any sort of document (no matter how small) takes sooooo long. One halfsheet of paper with minimal coloring took, I kid not, 7 minutes to complete printing. I'm going to fiddle with it a bit, maybe install a new ink cartridge I have lying about. However, a year is far too short a lifespan for this printer. I've had 20 dollar near-disposeable printers last me at least 2-3 years before conking out. It's been a few months since my last update, and this printer has pretty much bit the dust. The color side works just fine, but the black portion just went kaput. Streaks, areas with no ink. It prints as if the ink cartridge is low or out, even with a brand new cartridge installed. Whenever I set the machine to clean the printer head, it works fine for that day and then goes back to the awful streaks a day later. I can't afford the ink to keep cleaning it before each use. What's odd is that the streaks and gaps are always in the exact same area (when printing the same document). Considering that, I don't think the cartridge is at fault. There's something with that printer head and, unfortunately, I'm no printer technician....so I guess it's time to buy a new one. Maybe this time I'll go with an HP, though I really did love the fact that Brother ink could be replaced by individual color, unlike the HP ones which pairs all the colors in a single cartridge, which seems like such a waste.

For years I've stuck with the most basic of printers. Those fax/scan/bells and whistle printers were just not for me, I told myself. Then when my last printer (a 35 dollar HP) died on me, I started hunting around for its replacement. I had originally planned on going basic again, but I was dissatisfied with HP ink cartridges and how they required a new cartridge even if only one color went out. Plus, I use to be able to refill the HP cartridges, but with my last HP printer, it wouldn't register the ink. So I started researching printers that specifically had separate cartridges for each color. Brother and Epson were the two brands that kept coming up in my search. Well, I have a brother laser printer at my job that is a little workhorse...I mean that thing has been chugging along for years with nary a glitch. So I bit the bullet and purchased the MFCJ450DW.

I'll be honest, the wireless setup was not the easiest in the world, especially with the security setup I had. My SSID (which I only learned what that acronym stood for during the setup...I'm not a computer wizard...just a gal who reads directions well) wasn't recognized. When I manually configured it using what I knew was the name for my connection, the passkey wouldn't work. The only way I could get the thing to connect was by dropping my security down to open, make the connection with the passkey, then switch it back up to WPA2 after the fact. Took me a while of trial and error and reading up online for this to work, even with the setup wizard on the printer. I even tried the USB option, but it wouldn't register printer this way for some reason.

However, now that the wireless is up and running, I couldn't be happier. Love that it holds multiple sheets of paper in a tray (keeps it from flopping forward or gathering dust). Love that it can print on both sides of the paper without having to manually flip it...and that it will flip it long end or short end. Love that the ink cartridges are separate and that I found an Amazon market seller who sells compatible cartridges (very professional looking too...nicely boxed and no leaks or poorly constructed casings like with some generic ink companies) for a ridiculously low price. Love that it's really nicely constructed with a good heft to the scanner/copier and quality of scans. I swear, it really is comparable to the machines we have in our front office, yet it fits into a small corner of my room. Very, very impressive machine and well worth the price.

This cart as several pros:
* long handle - perfect for a tall person
* thick durable canvas material
* foldable to small compact size - easy to take wherever you go
* large size, which fits a lot of stuff
* nice top cover, which is good for privacy

CONS:
* the wheels are HORRIBLE!!! Way too SMALL and POOR QUALITY. Cannot support much weight.

I used this cart twice - to transport paper good to a child's birthday party. It worked well for that.

Recently I used the cart to transport groceries from,Whole Foods to my apartment. The distance? Only 11 blocks. Along the way the tires were destroyed, forcing me to DRAG the cart home. A Lovely stranger saw my plight and helped me carry the cart/groceries part of the way.

We get static at about 125' and dropped call at about 175'. The base is in stucco house and this is outside in free air with about 3 walls for the signal to go through. This is with 1 repeater at about the 100' mark. The handset will easily go to 250' without dropping the call with this setup. So it's good, but it's not the same performance as the handset.

Pros:

3 attachment methods. Over head, behind neck, in ear.
Sound quality very good.
No more wires. I have to keep a handset clipped to my belt and headset on my head.

Cons:

For some reason, it'll ""freak out."" By that I mean it'll start flashing the blue LED very rapidly for no reason. There is no call coming in and it'll do it with a full charge sitting on the charger or off the charger. Hitting the answer button will cause the base to reset and lose date/time. (Which keeps you from making calls from all phones.) I've duplicated this behavior multiple times and it's a real bug in the system. I'm going to try deregistering everything and re-registering everything to see if that helps.

No hold button. Finally got Music On Hold working, but it's useless w/o a hold button on this headset.

Mute/vol up and vol down buttons in a very bad location on the phone. I constantly hit one of them anytime I remove it from my head. Hitting the mute button unintentionally can be a problem.

No keypad and no voice recognition, so you can't initiate a call. You can transfer into this headset, but once it's transferred to the headset, you have to go to the base that it's paired to to transfer out.

Some static, no matter where we are, but it's not too bad. It depends on the orientation of your head more than distance.

Added a 2nd repeater and now get 500' if any direction from base thru buildings and walls no problem.

It really needs a redesign for the button, a hold button is sorely needed, and a keypad would make it near perfect.

Then missing at the unusually high price are an automatic document feeder and fax and the ability to scan larger items like books.  Add a pretty dated design and some seriously cheap plastic parts.  What do you have?  A name that is barely known in the printer business compared to the grandaddies HP, Epson and Canon (remember those names in inkjet printers that are long gone like Xerox?)

So what about its so-called major virtue, cheap ink?

And then there's that universal warning about worrying about the cost of ink cartridges for your printer ... it's not how much the cartridge costs, but how many pages you will get out of the cartridge.

Other than that, Kodak is a known and trusted name and the printer is functional.  If you buy one you will probably find it does about as good a job as any other brand.  Printers are a commodity anymore, they're all good.  I would make just one final observation.  Inkjet printers ALL cost a lot to operate, even for black-only text.  Your best bet is to own two printers ... a laser for 85% of what you will ever print, and an inkjet for the rare times you really need color.

Overall I'm quite disappointed in their long-term performance, especially for the price and all the marketing hype.  I guess that's what these come down to - pure hype.  They tout names of famous writers like Hemingway and Chatwin almost as if they actually used their products.  I know for a fact that Ernest Hemingway died before the Moleskine Srl *brand* of notebooks came into being.  Sure, the old writers used to use ""moleskine"" or leather-bound notebooks, but they were handmade and undoubtedly of better quality.  These aren't even leather bound; they are bound with some kind of plastic simulated leather.

The paper is of decent quality, but bleeds through pretty easily and frays at the edges.

But the most irritating thing about the Moleskine Srl notebooks is the fact that the binding is as fragile as eggshells.  Every single one of the notebooks I've been through has required reinforcement by tape and/or glue before 1/3 of the pages had been written on.  They just cannot handle day-to-day repetitive use.  The threads come apart, the pages work loose from the threads, and the faux leather binding cracks at the ""hinge"" area.  Eventually the strip of paper in the spine that's holding together the mini booklets of paper inside eventually rips and the binding just falls apart from within.

I suppose the only reason I've used so many of them was because I just wanted to a good notebook and they sure *seem* like they'd be good when you pick one up in the store.  Like Mulder on the X-Files, I really wanted to believe in Moleskine.  And I wanted to give the product an honest chance before giving up on it.  But now I'm convinced they are not worthy of my good notes.  Maybe I'll use the ones I still have for mundane stuff like shopping lists or something.  They COULD be a good notebook if Moleskine could just build a durable binding.

For now, for my ""good notes"" that are worth keeping, I'm switching over to the Leuchtturm 1917 pocket notebooks.  I'll go through a few of those and then write a review on them.  So far, they seem much more promising even though the Leuchtturms have more of a ""perfect"" type binding and the pages do not lay flat like on the Moleskine.  I can live with that, though.","Stay away, stay away",1305417600,8,

It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't allow embedded pictures in product reviews.
So if you are interested in seeing the review with pictures please visit my website (which I can't link to here :/)

I swear I read somewhere online (I did a lot of research before buying the Doxie Go) that the initial battery charge took about 4-6 hours. My initial charge took close to 8 - 9 hours. :(

After charging the battery I powered up the Doxie Go and feed it it's Calibration sheet. I can't find any documentation on how often one should calibrate their Doxie [...]

Being a tech, I wanted to put the Doxie Go through a number of tests. The first thing I grabbed to scan was the included 8.5 x 11 looking poster featuring the Doxie mascot (?) (a Doxie scanner with arms and legs). This sheet was folded, so I straightened it out and put it through the scanner. It got stuck when it hit the ""bump fold"" but then continued to pull the sheet through.

Yeah my very first scan had ""issues""...

[photo examples unable to display via Amazon review]

Okay so the first scan had a problem with a ""bump fold""... I immediately wanted to scan the other side of the sheet which had what I call a ""valley fold"". The scanner pulled it through just fine, so a close inspection of the scan would have to be done...

[photo examples unable to display via Amazon review]

""Valley fold"" scans have a noticeable shadowing to the scans within the ""valley"". This is kind-of expected of sheet fed scanners but seriously, it's kind-of a pain. My higher end Fujitsu scanner does a much better job at dealing with both ""bump"" and ""valley"" folds. I was hoping that the Doxie would too, unfortunately it doesn't.

Other ""Issues"":

Skewing of scans - due to pulling in the sheet crooked... This is a SERIOUSLY HUGE problem for the Doxie scanners, whether Apparent wants to admit it or not. The Doxie Go's sensor telling the scanner that a piece of paper is waiting to be pulled in and scanned is, IMHO to [..] anxious to pull in documents, often pulling in documents while I was still trying to align them up with the left side and adjusting the paper guide.

I have to say that close to 95% of my scans all had some visible skewing issue to them (indicated by the tell tale sign of a BLACK negative space as part of the scan). Now, believe me when I say that I got pretty good a feeding a scan in what I consider ""perfectly"" so that there shouldn't be any skew. But the damn thing would still pull in scans crooked or too quickly before I got them aligned tight left and with the paper guide...

Score Card:

Rather than continue explaining every negative, I've summed up a lot of them in the ""Cons"" section below... So make sure you read through the extensive list. :-/

Pros:

+ A truly portable (PC free) simplex document scanner

+ Scans at 300 DPI or 600 DPI

+ Scans up to 8.5 x 15"" (so US LEGAL)

+ Has internal memory w/support for SDHC and USB Flash Drives

+ Has a built in rechargeable battery

+ Supports Eye-Fi WiFi SDHC Memory Cards

+ Decent Software (with OCR capabilities) for the Mac and PC (sorry Linux users)

+ Comes with a small special scanning sleeve for ""old or glossy photos""

Somewhere in the middle, your milage may vary:

 Customer support via Twitter and Email was very quick and responsive

Cons:

- Detailed ""User Manual""  is HIDDEN under the Doxie App's ""Help"" menu (at least under Mac OS X)

- Costly, the scanner alone is around $200, other ""add ons"" inflate the cost even more (e.g.: power-cord=$10, case=$30, WiFi-storage=$30, etc)

- Feels Cheaply Made (feels like the Doxie needs the optional $30 case just to keep it from getting banged up in a professional's bag)

- SCANNER tries to grip the sheet to quickly (IMHO) often causing skewed scans

- Scans are often SKEWED and/or include BLACK space because scans aren't always pulled in straight (even when using the included page guide)

- Scans of pages with folds often have ""issues"" causing skewing, shadowing, or jams

- Users shouldn't have to ""learn"" how get straight scans even when using the page guide

- Software by DEFAULT deletes the scans on the Doxie SCANNER when imported into the Doxie APP

- Software by DEFAULT sets PDF Image quality to ""6 Medium"" and JPEG image quality to ""9 (High)"", which IMHO should DEFAULT to the maximum

- It's not apparently clear where the Doxie APP temporarily stores imported scans on the computer

- Power cord is an extra purchase (~$10)

- I wasn't able to get the Doxie to scan while being charged via my Mac's USB port, which would make me lean towards having to use a USB power adapter, or the optional $10 power cord

- Has a built in rechargeable battery that can't be swapped out for AA or AAA when in a pinch

- Scans are saved as JPEGS and need to be converted later to PDF/OCR-PDF or PNG with the PC software

- Doxie Software sometimes makes bad decisions and tries to incorrectly ""auto"" correct scans (DEFAULT behavior)

- Wireless (WiFi) capability is an extra purchase (~$30+)

- No Linux compatible software

- Included carrier sheet (""scanning sleeve"") is small and is marketed for ""old or glossy photos"", there should at least be a FULL 8.5 x 15 carrier sheet for odd shaped scans (think news paper clippings)

The plastic seal around it doesn't allow for anything falling out, so it was overlooked. The flimsy tray for markers didn't want to stay in place, but we've got it reinforced now. The marker itself is lightweight with a small magnet on one side so it will stay on the board, we like that feature, but the ink itself is not as dark as other markers we've used.

This was acquired through the vine program, for my honest review. In all fairness, I could not give this a good rating. It is pricey for the quality one gets.

I figured Motorola was a reputable brand, and appreciated the third handset which I put in the living room.

My initial impression was a bit of disappointment in that the sound quality wasn't as good as my former Panasonic phone. There's a tinny quality to people's voices, and it sounds a bit like they're in a tight, enclosed box. This model wasn't as user-friendly as the Panasonic and the buttons were a bit stiff to use.

I could deal with all that, but just two weeks ago (approximately five months later), there is now a crackling sound that covers up people's voices, as well as some sort of strange digital quality to speakers, so that I can't understand anything someone is saying. The person on the other end, however, says I'm coming in very clearly. I called Verizon and the techs showed me how clear the line was when they used the phone they brought with them. Their conclusion was that my ""equipment"" (i.e., the 5-month old Motorola phone) was defective. Since I bought it off a deal site, I can't return it. I can give an honest review, though, and perhaps prevent someone else from buying it.

I now have to spend more money at a ""real"" store to replace it and I'm going to buy another Panasonic item. Shame on Motorola for selling such low-quality stuff!

This is by far the most troublesome printer I have owned.  I am so frustrated with it, I can't put it in words.  I have called customer support, they were little or not help.  I got it working after some hours (initial start up) using my own ingenuity and experience.  Now, for the 5th time, it will not print, saying it has ""print head problems"", but there is no way to fix them, apparently.  Also, in doing on line research I find that if a cartridge is removed from the machine for over 30 minutes, it could ruin the machine and the cartridge both.  Does that make any sense?  I have not done that, but that's a warning for readers that is buried deep in the trouble shooting guides. I have the ""Instant Ink"" option and the telephone staff managing that are nice, and competent, unlike those on the hardware help line.  They have shipped a far amount of ""instant ink"" but often only 1 cartridge in a box, followed the next day by a box of 2 cartridges. They waste much postage by now just sending a set at one time.  The glossy prints (when I can get it to work) are a bit dark, and lesser quality than my Canon that sits right beside it.

This seemed to be the more ""serious"" of the two, so I checked out, and waited to make some confetti.

Assembly was straightforward, and the instructions were only necessary to figure out where the two locking casters were supposed to go.

I put in a sheet of paper, and it was dutifully reduced to confetti. Much nicer than the strip shredders I had before, and now, there's no way someone's going to be able to go through my garbage and reconstruct my shameful collection of Starbucks receipts. I was impressed.

Then I started shredding things that had been piling up, and noticed very quickly that this shredder is kind of wimpy. At about four pages, it starts making some really sad noises. And when I tried some credit card junk mail, it totally choked -- leaving me to think ""Gee, even those free shredders were able to tell Citibank 'no thanks'."" Speaking of credit cards, I happened to have one that expired last month, and gave that a shot. On one hand, the card has been totally obliterated, thanks to this shredder. On the other, it seemed like such a chore for the poor machine, I almost felt bad.

The real pain, though, is the slot. If your documents aren't pristine and flat, set a little time aside to get them to go in to the very awkward slot. If you're okay with sitting down and feeding this sheet-by-sheet, you should be fine. Otherwise, this is a pain to use.

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051CKX4U/

I just loaded a tray of slides into this scanner and it's scanning as I type.  It sounds like it's grinding slides but, apparently, it's not.  It calibrates itself for every slide it scans.  It's easy to use once you get over the badly produced operations manual for the CyberView (tm) software you have to use to get full access to all of the features of the machine.  Once you get over the clunky user interface, it seems to do what it claims to do.

I guess you can live with a non-standardized interface because you're not going to scan slides forever now that digital imaging has taken over photography.  Would I buy this machine again?  Yes, if only because it seems to be the only offering for this sort of operation - not for its robust build.

It's been two hours since I sstarted scanning my first tray of slides.  We're on slide number 31.  On the network I can tell that the scans are really very good but it's really, really slow.  My next job will be set to run overnight.  I'd just as soon sleep through this operation.  I expect that, all in all, it will have been well worth the effort and waiting tu use this thing because I'd have never had the patience to do all this work manually.

Two days later:

The software sent with this scanner (CyberView (tm)) is some of the worst I've ever encountered.  It can't shut down without an error message from Windows asking you if you wish to report this problem.  It has to install itself each time you want to run it.  It can't detect the state of the scanner and more.  It's as if it was written by an Indian committee convened to oversee the committees assembled to write it on a zero budget.  Oh, yes, it's better than nothing, but just barely.  It would be nice if this company had hired programmers to write the software.",Worst interface I've seen yet - for ANY product.,1404691200,11,

I was looking for an affordable printer that would print nice photos as well as my kids school projects that need to be in color.  Believe it or not I almost bought a much more expensive Canon printer but in the end decided I don't print enough to warrant spending over two hundred dollars on one and this printers had good reviews on all the websites I searched.  However, buying it was a big mistake.

The Negatives are:
1) It does NOT print borderless pictures.  It was my mistake to assume that all photo printers did this.  My old HP7760 was nearly 10 years old and it printed beautiful, borderless prints.  So the 4 by 6 HP photo paper I bought is now filled with prints that are 3.75"" by 5.25""
2) The photos are not crisp.
3) Each photo came out with a large smudge from the roller.
4) Regular everyday color printing on plain paper saturates the paper
5) There is no paper tray (it is loaded in the top).  So once opened to hold paper, it needs twice the height requirement for space
6) There is no dedicated tray for 4 by 6 photo paper like many photo printers have
7) It is L-O-U-D and shakes while printing

The positives
1) It is affordable
2) Everyday color printing looks decent enough for a kids school project (but it does oversaturate the ink)
3) It was easy to set up
4) It did print on 110 lb cardstock with no problems, which is a bonus for making your own cards

Overall, I am not very happy with the quality of this printer and plan to return it.  Being able to print a nice looking borderless picture that is not smudged from the rollers, is very important to me.  If my kids had a dedicated workspace and didn't share my computer and printers, I would likely keep it for them since it is so cheap and would do an adequate job for the type of color printing they typically need.

Since it is portable, I figured I could just clamp this baby on any desk or table I might find onsite, thus allowing me to quickly and easily set up a little portable office and type away.  I do a lot of typing on my laptop, so I have a plug-in ergonomic keyboard.  It is very important for me to have my keyboard at the right position.  I did not want to go to the trouble and expense of purchasing a computer desk to set up in the other city.

This, I thought, was the perfect solution.

Sheesh.  Was I wrong. This sucker is huge.  It's so large that I don't have a suitcase or bag large enough to carry it in.

Then I discovered that I could NOT clamp it on JUST ANY desk or table.  This baby needs a full three feet of uninterrupted desktop width and two feet of uninterrupted desktop depth (front to back) UNDER THE DESKTOP in order to clamp it on.  It is too wide to fit on a card table, but even had it fit width-wise, the table leg folding mechanism was in the way.  Every desk or kitchen table or dining room table I tried to clamp it onto, had a vertical piece of decorative trim under the table top that prevented me from attaching the keyboard drawer to it -- or a brace or a leg or a shelf or a drawer or a support-something.

If your desk is an old wooden door supported by two filing cabinets, this will work perfectly for you.

Finally I tried it on my white plastic folding banquet table that is six feet across.  Voila!  The keyboard drawer fits nicely with mere inches before the table's handle interferes, clamps on easily enough.  There is space for my bulky ergonomic keyboard&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Natural-Ergonomic-Keyboard-4000/dp/B000A6PPOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</a>and comfortable space for the mouse on the side.  I appreciate that the drawer is configured such that you can put the mouse either to the left or to the right of the keyboard.  The keyboard is at the right height, and has three different height settings that can be used.

I am pounding away on it right now as I am typing this review.  There is a bit of up and down wobbling with every keystroke, but not enough to deter me.  It seems quite sturdy and I am pleased with it.

I haven't decided if I am going to keep it or return it.  If I keep it, my dream of easy portability will be hampered by having to also carry with me this six-foot folding plastic table.  It might just be easier to find a cheap rolling computer cart with keyboard slide.

I'll post an update in a few weeks to let you know what I decided.  *Edited to add: For $20 I purchased a small used computer desk.  Since the keyboard drawer isn't exactly portable or travel-friendly, I decided it was cheaper to buy the desk, set it up once and leave it in the other city.  When the temporary job is done, the desk was so cheap that I can throw it away if it's too much trouble to bring it home.",This thing is huge!,1333756800,7,

I had the unit sitting on top of a 15-inch wastebasket, supported by the extension (see product images).

I've posted a photo of the broken part.

-----
Original review.

Let's make things straight from the start - this is not an industrial-strength shredder.  It is only rated for eight sheets of paper, and it's not lightning fast.  That said, it seems to be perfectly well suited for home use.  One of the primary reasons that I was interested in this unit is because I want to be able to shred old credit cards rather that cut them up by hand.

To test this unit, I ran an old CD, an expired credit card, and several sheets of paper through the unit.  It's actually more accurate to say that this device breaks (rather than shreds) CDs, as a CD is rendered into four pieces.  The credit card was, however, shredded.  (See product images.)

The CD goes into a different slot than the credit card and the paper.  To get the CD and credit card into the machine, a slight bit of pressure needed to be applied.  Only one credit card or one CD at a time can be run through the machine.

Pros:
The machine accepted up to 14 sheets of paper at a time, but it ran slowly.  It was asking a bit much of the poor thing to have it shred 16 sheets.  It did it, but only reluctantly, and I wouldn't recommend doing so.  I didn't push it further, as I didn't want to have to clean out a jam.  Therefore, I would say that the 8-sheet rating is accurate, and you don't have to closely count the number of sheets before you shove them in.  For the long-term health and continued cheerful cooperation of the unit, it's probably not a good idea to consistently ask it to do more than its job description requires.

It shredded the credit card and broke the CD without any problem whatsoever.

The instruction sheet is very clear, and contains information regarding use and basic maintenance.

Cons:
A couple of ""features"" of this shredder are not so hot (at least from my perspective):
 (1) the size of the basket - it's about 11 x 12 x 6, smaller than the posted dimensions suggest.
 (2) the shape and size of the shredding mechanism.
  3) this is not a cross-cut shredder, and therefore not the best for confidential documents.

When I first saw the small size of the basket I assumed that the shredding mechanism could easily be set on top of a larger wastebasket.  Well.... not really.  As Maxwell Smart might say, ""Missed it by that much.""

The top piece is adjustable, and can be extended to about 15 inches.  However, the ends are curved, and the unit doesn't sit that snugly on top of a rectangular wastebasket.  Let's call it a ""meh"" fit.  It would probably be difficult to find a larger basket that it would fit nicely.  (Update: I have been using it on top of a 15-inch wastebasket.  While it only sits on top of the basket, I have found it to be more stable than I originally anticipated.)

Toss-up:
I would prefer to be able to detach the cord from the shredding mechanism, but it is permanently attached.  In this case, some people may like this configuration, others might not.

The real test of this device will be in terms of its long-term durability.  Of course, that is impossible to judge durability at this time.  It does come with a one year warranty, and the Amazon product page shows a 1-800 customer service line for the device.  I am using it every single day to shred junk mail, and will see how it holds up.

If it dies a premature death, I will update this review with all the gory details.  Likewise, if this shredder proves itself to be a shredder beyond shredders, a paragon of its species, I will be sure to give credit where credit is due.",Updated:  Epic Fail in less than a year.,1314057600,231,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61G8TmKbOoL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61j7ZisBIBL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+AC2ijXOL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61LuQFbNFAL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RgfAOuQ+L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MMfK2fFGL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mBriaUO0L._SY88.jpg']"

Installation is flawed.  The installation routine installs the Button Manager, but fails on the Twain software & driver to control the scanner.  You have to go to the TWAIN folder, then find and run that setup.exe.  And there is no mention of that.  I just guessed at it.

The manual says you can set the switch functions, but I have not been able to accomplish that so far.  One thing I wanted to do was set the date / time clock, and that seems to have happened in the background while I was trying to set up the software.  (One good point.)

I do not like the double ended USB cable, but can see how that would be helpful if your computer does not have the amps to run the scanner.  Instead, you must charge it before trying to use it.  I do like the removable AP-120 battery.  You could get a spare battery and charger.  (Another good point.)

De-skew and auto crop are needed but are not working so far.  Most of the time, the paper is not pulled in perfectly straight because there is no easy to perfectly align the document.  As to the image, that is an issue.  If the paper is a little thin, the image will be horrible with many spots.  Anything under 20# is going to be a problem.  Even 20# paper may not be thick enough to eliminate the spots.  I have some medium quality 20# paper, and the scanner shows spots that do not exist.  In the grey mode, you get exactly that.... A gray image for a white original.  Really bad.

The size is bigger (3"" x 2.25"" x almost 12"") than some other portable scanners, scans only one side, and there is no case or pouch.  The Brother scanners are smaller and would be perfect, but for the stupid gray programming problem in portable mode.

Just got this Avision and just started working with it.  I am not happy having to spend a lot of time getting it working and figured out.  I have not decided to keep it or not.  I would never use it at my desk, but maybe it will be OK as a traveling scanner.

Avision needs to fix their installation, software, and manual.  Watch out for all the reviews from people who got theirs for free.  Their scores have been influenced, if not bought.",Bad installation and software.  OK scanner???,1469836800,14,

1 storage binder
1 clipboard

1 Envelope

-Constructed well (sturdy)
-Being able to tilt the desk makes it easier on wrists and harder to spill your drink on your computer
-Adjustable legs (many laptop desks lack this)

-The lowest angle you can tilt the tray is just a little too high. Wish there was one more notch.

The print quality was impressive but I could not get the thing to run reliably and print on the 80 pound stock I was using.

It kept insisting I had no more magenta toner, but when I followed the steps in the user's guide to replace the toner, the display failed to offer the proper responses.  By the way, the amount of toner that originally came with the 1650 was pitiful.  I got maybe 50 color pages total before I had to replace the toner.

I tried these in different sizes and brands of binders (Amazon Basics, Staples, Avery and two random/unknown binders that I've had for almost 30 years)  and while they fit all of these width-wise, the are too tall for all of them and it's annoying. Researching online, I found that some binders are made narrower than average, so that width could be a problem unless you don't mind things sticking out of your binders.  (I mind, I'm anal that way. I want everything to fit within the boundaries so they sit nicely on the shelves)

*** ACTUAL measurements are:  H: 11.825""  x W: 10.5.  When used in the ring, these Pockets stick out beyond the edge by over .75"". ***

I checked office supply websites and found accurate dimensions and see a variety of measurements for ""letter size three-ring binders"".

I'll use them and make my own ""binders"" to fit them, so they won't go to waste, but I don't think I'd buy them again unless I find taller and wider binders, which isn't likely.

2.0,True,"06 22, 2016",A2DD5SU0YZH2OC,B00JOI5O8C,{'Style:': ' Printer'},Scott,"Update: found another irritating thing about the HP 7612 (& the HP 7610) Now HP has come up with the ""HP protected cartridge"".  I have sent my HP 7610 in for extended warranty repair/replacement.  Since both the HP 7610 and the HP 7612 use the same ink cartridge, I put the magenta 933xl ink cartridge from my 7610 into my 7612.  The 7612 will not let me use it because it is a ""HP protected cartridge""!  So evidently my HP 7610 has protected this ink cartridge so it cannot be used in any other printer, and since the extended warranty company will probably send me another refurbished 7610, none of my used ink cartridges will not work in the replacement printer either.  So now I am out 70.00+ of ink cartridges, on top of of the inconvenience of having to be without one of my printers for who knows how long.  I did not turn this ""cartridge protection"" feature on, in either printer, it may be a default setting?  So unless your in an office that has problems with people taking your ink cartridges, I recommend deactivating this feature before you get robbed too.  (I had to go on the internet to find out how to deactivate the cartridge protection feature; [...])  Seems like HP really wants me to switch to another brand of printer.
  As usual with all HP printers they are equal parts, quality and junk.  The printer can produce excellent quality prints, but the ink is expensive, and the paper feeder is finicky and unreliable.  The printer is constantly notifying me that it is out paper, when it still has paper, I have to adjust the paper several times to get it to start printing, and I will occaisionally get paper jams, especially with thicker good quality photo paper (even HP paper).  The new HP driver software no longer gives me a onscreen notices; i.e. that the ink is low or empty or out of paper.  I will be working along in Photoshop, and suddenly notice that the printer has stopped printing, usually because it is out of ink, or the paper tray is empty (sometimes it is actually out of paper)  The HP software for other HP printers that I have owned, use to show onscreen pop up windows that gave you the ink and paper status, but for some reason it no longer does that.  I definitely recommend buying extended warranties for any HP printer, the longer warranty the better, I have used the extended warranty on every HP printer I have bought in the last 8 years. The HP 7610 printer I own, has some of the same issues as the 7612, is going in for warranty work again, (the extended warranty company just sends a replacement refurbished printer).  Why keep buying HP printers, you ask, because everyone I speak too, or reviews I read, about other printers on the market, have all the same problems with those other brands of printers, as I have with HP printers!  If I could find something better I would switch brands in a second.  It is sad, HP use to make reliable printers, I have a HP Laserjet 1200 printer that is still going strong, and I purchased it in March 2002, over 14 years ago, and I have never had any need to get it repaired, (knock on wood).","unreliable paper feeder, expensive ink, irritating features, good quality prints",1466553600,2,

Called customer support and they were very nice but had no answer for us and offer to replce the cartridges. On a  hunch I replaced the roller carriage and the problem resolved however it troubled me that the original carriage was working fine with the old toner.

Now several weeks later the toner cartridge is emitting a squeaking noise when we print so I am disappointed in the quality of the toner. I have three more of their toner cartridges in stock so I hope they will be better...

This is by far the most troublesome printer I have owned.  I am so frustrated with it, I can't put it in words.  I have called customer support, they were little or not help.  I got it working after some hours (initial start up) using my own ingenuity and experience.  Now, for the 5th time, it will not print, saying it has ""print head problems"", but there is no way to fix them, apparently.  Also, in doing on line research I find that if a cartridge is removed from the machine for over 30 minutes, it could ruin the machine and the cartridge both.  Does that make any sense?  I have not done that, but that's a warning for readers that is buried deep in the trouble shooting guides. I have the ""Instant Ink"" option and the telephone staff managing that are nice, and competent, unlike those on the hardware help line.  They have shipped a far amount of ""instant ink"" but often only 1 cartridge in a box, followed the next day by a box of 2 cartridges. They waste much postage by now just sending a set at one time.

2.0,False,"05 8, 2014",A36Y7X194VWVKA,B00F9Z3RWO,{'Style:': ' 2 Cordless Handset'},Mark D.,"I really wanted to like this phone.  The specs said it had every feature I was looking for... full-duplex speakerphone, DECT 6 wireless, two lines, handsets that take standard AAA NIMH batteries, speakerphones on the handsets, a dedicated headset jack, extensible handsets and it even had Bluetooth capabilities. As a result, even though it costed almost 50% more than the competition, I pulled the trigger.

Problem is I shot my foot off. The specs are not accurate.

First, they claim the base has a full-duplex speakerphone. Simply put, it does not.

To test, I had people on the phone with me repeat the alphabet with no gaps or pauses during which I would would say a sentence while I was on the speaker.  None of them heard me.  I tried the reverse where I was saying the alphabet and they tried to speak. In that case, I *could* hear them, but that's because the phone cut *me* off and the other person reported they heard gaps in me reciting the alphabet.  The take-away is the phone prefers the other end of the call and will cut you off locally if you're on speaker.  Not much of a 'duplex' feature if you ask me.

The handsets also have a speakerphone, but at best they can be called 'whisper'-phones.  At full volume they were about half of the competition's volume level. Usable in a quiet room, but not if the TV is on or others are around you talking.

The other thing is the cell integration.  I'm in a typical home office with a machine and a Bluetooth keyboard.  Not much else interference-wise.  I have an iPhone 5S which paired immediately with the phone (good sign!) and I could make and receive iPhone calls from it as expected.  However, the call quality was not that good. Passable, but not much else.

The instructions also says it supports both wired and wireless headsets at the base: the former through a 2.5mm jack and the latter through the phone's Bluetooth setting.  There again, the wired set sounded crisp and clear, but a Bluetooth headset that sounds great when connected to the iPhone directly sounded like crap.  The people on the other end said the call was staticy and crackly and it was basically unusable.

Simply put, Panasonic has not figured out Bluetooth.  It reminds me of when it first came out and everyone was wearing those blue-blinking ear-roaches and call quality stunk, but it was still neat because it was new.  Well five years later, it ain't new and this is a disgrace.

The reason this phone gets a 2 over a 1-star is the form factor is great.  The large screen is gorgeous and the accouterments like the aforementioned 2.5mm headset jacks on the base *and* all the handsets, or the charging USB port for your phone are really nice additions.  It's also great how you can sync your phone's contacts with the base. Those are the reasons I wanted, and I mean really, really wanted to love this phone, but I can't because at the root of everything, this is a phone and it's supposed to make calls, and the call quality just isn't there at any price, let alone a premium price like this.

Shockingly it's the things I dislike that have swayed my opinion.

Pros:
Beautiful design.
Weighted nicely
Love that the lead indicator is not a loose cover. Some pencils have this but it slips, so it isn't accurate. not here. holds where you leave it.

Cons
only one, but it's a biggie. I don't understand how a pencil that costs this much can have such a design flaw. it has a substantial amount of 'play' in the tip. not sure what else to call it. other idea would be slop. It reminds me of how red line lenses from Cannon have this slop where you shake it, and you can hear it move around, almost rattle. however, with those lenses  it's not effecting the outcome of the pic. This pencil has a large amount of play. so when you click down the lead, the tip will shift the first time you hit it to the paper.

Sounds minor, well, as an artist it is not minor it's major. it's supposed to be a PRECISION instrument. how can this have that much slop when a cheap 2 dollar mechanical doesn't.

I am returning this thing. I'm only bothered now that I don't know where to turn. I was hoping to make a firm decision and stick with Rotring. i bought this 600. I was planning on buying another in silver, then two 800's. one black one silver, all used for different things. But now I am abandoning that completely.

I saw another person review the 800 and he complained about the slop in it as well. I wrote it off figuring it wasn't really true. Then i got mine. mine isn't even the same model, but it has the exact slop he complained about.

I don't know what to do, I'm not a big aficionado of mechanical pencils so i don't even know what brand to start looking at. I thought I'd found the right one.

wow, disappointed is an understatement. My style of art is very precise, very straight and defined lines for shading. i don't use crosshatching. it's all based on single lines in the same direction. But with this slop, it's not usable.",Supremely dissapointed,1398643200,8,

However...

We were in the habit of taping over the shipping address on the printed labels to provide a degree of water-proofness in case they get wet. Sometimes the label just gets taped over when sealing the pack. One of our customers emailed advising us that the printing on the label had severely faded underneath the tape to the point that it was almost unreadable (we use 3M clear shipping tape). So we did an experiment with the three or four brands of labels we had. These enKo labels severely faded to be close to illegible within a day. In fact all labels we tried except those brand named iMBAPrice and sold by Amadax fade, all the others severely faded within 24 hours underneath the clear tape. After three days the labels are completely blank to the first glance and need to be studied closely to read them.

The experiment we did used actual duplicate customer labels so I need to repeat with something generic and update this review with pictures.

I suspect (but don't know) that there may be two main manufacturers of this type of shipping label sold under different names. Also, I notice several reviews of the iMBAPrice labels complaining that those labels do fade under packing tape, so perhaps different manufacturers products are being sold under the same name. The ones that do not fade have a larger bend radius of maybe 2mm vs about 1mm of those that do fade.

March 1, 2017, I am changing my rating on these pencils,  after using these pencils they are the poor quality compared to  Prang. I have purchased a box of prang pencils and the quality is far better than the sergeant. The sergeant pencils tend to drag when coloring and they are also very hard to blend. They do come in beautiful and a wide variety of colors. I probably will not re-purchase these pencils. Sometimes I just pull a color from my stack and I can always tell when I have pulled a sergeant color, it drags and won't blend very well. They also will not layer either.

More or less a brick.  But it hasn't been smooth sailing up to this point.  First off, you only get about 100-150 pages out of a cartridge unless you buy the XL.  That is just terrible.  And aftermarket cartridges aren't really an option for this printer.  Refills work ok but it doesn't really matter because the printer started smearing and skipping lines a while back and none of the built in fixes on the printer or other troubleshooting options work.
As another gripe, this printer clearly stated it could print files (including pdfs) from a usb drive.  Yet it prints only pictures, not pdfs or any other common file format.  So... it's totally useless without a wireless connection.
Also, the 123 print online thing they promised never worked despite a decent amount of troubleshooting (I worked IT for a while, so I can do the basics).
So, a printer that can't really print.  Why 2 stars?  The stars are for the scanner function, which does actually work better than other printers I've had.  And, the printer does connect to my wireless without issue, which I can no longer take for granted after a few Canon printers with connection issues.
Overall, I generally have to ask why printers (Canon, HP, everyone) seem to get worse every year, given that my HP printer from 15 years ago worked almost flawlessly for years before being replaced over software incompatibility.  I'm not the type to look back at old products nostalgically, I genuinely objectively believe home printers have sunk in quality.

Hitting the button would bring up an HP splash screen on the computer, but it froze there. Lesson learned: the ""scan"" button on the machine is useless.

Then we went into the ""HP Photo # Imaging Gallery"" software. It worked for 3 scans, but on the 4th one, it appeared to scan fine, but the document file never showed up in the gallery window.

We tried it with another scanning application, and again it appeared to scan fine, but the software never received the data. No error, nothing.

I tried downloading a ""critical update"" for the HP software, and it arrived as an executable WinZip file. Unfortunately, it tried to unpack to a directory on C: but the computer in question doesn't have a C: drive, so the WinZip self-extractor said ""Drive c is not a valid drive, unzip operation canceled"" and exited.

Anyway, I then noticed the link that lets HP analyze your system for needed upgrades, but it found that the driver for the OfficeJet was up-to-date.

My HP Scanjet also 3300C has funny drivers. They don't like it when I disconnect power to the scanner before ""disconnecting"" the scanner in Windows. I think it used to crash Windows, before I upgraded the drivers. Now it merely complains. But it shouldn't complain at all!

Also, my uncle tried getting the fax part to work, but he hit an unresolvable problem (I don't remember what it was).

At work, we also use a different model of OfficeJet for faxing. That has problems feeding paper, and it just doesn't work as well as the Brother machine that sits beside it.

From now on, I can't recommend any HP device with a scanner, due to the poor quality of the drivers. But to be honest to myself and HP, I still like my Deskjet 970CSE. And the OfficeJet 6110 prints fine, which is why I give this 2 stars instead of 1.",Buggy Software,1111536000,7,

- Durable, black powder-coated sheet metal construction, can likely handle more of a load than your typical letter organizer.
- Can be used on a desktop, or mounted on a wall using the four holes in the back plate; two holes above the top tray, and two holes above the bottom tray.
- Trays are angled slightly to help keep things from falling out easily.
- Six trays! It's surprisingly a little difficult to find anything with more than five trays.

No Like!
- My unit arrived with bent sides, bulging out between the trays. Whether this is the result of poor quality control or bad shipping, I'm not sure.
- The tray second to the bottom was welded on crooked, partially obscuring one of the mounting holes at the bottom. This was definitely a manufacturer defect.

Yes, they've textured the plastic finish for good grip, but the balance is off.

Beware of the Support Code B200

I've had this printer since February 2015 and have used it for personal and small business printing.  It has worked fine up until yesterday when I tried to print shipping labels and the LCD screen showed Support Code B200.  It will not let me print, scan, fax or copy.  So I searched online for a fix and emailed Canon Support.  I found thousands of complaints about the B200 code and multiple home hack solutions.  Ultimately it comes down to this, if you get a B200 code you will need to take your printer to a service center if it is out of warranty.  My printer had a 1 year warranty.  I have had this printer plugged into a high quality surge protector, have used only genuine Canon ink, it's not used for production runs just label printing and typical small business document printing.

Canon replied to my request for service with:
""The B200 error refers to an internal hardware problem that doesn't point to a specific part of the printer.  There are several things that can cause service errors like the B200 to appear.  These may include, but not limited to, experiencing a power outage or voltage fluctuation, paper jam, or using third-party inks for an extended period of time.  To try to resolve this error, please unplug the printer's power cord from the power source for about 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes, please connect the printer directly to a wall outlet, and not to a power strip.  Turn the printer back on to see if the error message will come back.
If the problem persists, the printer has to be taken to a service facility where it will be taken apart by a technician to see what is causing the error.  I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.""

Unfortunately their trick and every other trick I found on the internet did not work either.  They are fully aware that there are thousands of printers giving this code and will not stand behind their product for replacement.  Although it worked great when it did work, I now have to replace a printer that should be covered by Canon for a known issue.

Below is the original review.

Purchased this to replace an HP Wireless printer and this printer works great compared to the HP.  I was always loosing connection to the HP and printing was always bad.  The Canon PIXMA MX922 prints like a champ.  The ink is easier to find and the biggest plus is that it will print when one color is out unlike other printers who stop printing black because the blue is out.

There are 2 paper trays, one for photo paper and one for regular copy paper which is just a great idea and every printer should have this feature.

Flatbed scanning and auto document feed tray works great, and helps with organizing digital versions of paper copies to reduce clutter at home.  The scans are very crisp and I have had no problem with this feature.  I have not used the fax feature of the printer, not sure why anyone faxes anything these days when there is a scanner and email available.

The footprint of the printer is quite a bit larger than I thought it would be.  It's manageable and fits on top of my 2 drawer filling cabinet with some overhanging on the sides.

This is the first printer that I have not had any issues with.  even the software is decent.  I don't use all the software but the utility to print scan and copy work as they should.  The wi-fi works great with my Macbook Pro, iPhone 4s, iPad 2, Iphone 5s and is easy to set up.  Unlike other wi-fi printers I have owned or used this one doesn't loose connectivity on a regular basis.  Only issue I had with connectivity was after a power outage and that may have been cause by the modem and router.

Pros:
 - It is compact and can fit under the seat of my car

Cons:
 - The safe really stinks; I cannot pinpoint exactly what it smells like, but it is very off putting and every time I handled it I have to thoroughly wash my hands and had to remove it from my car
 - Setting it up is extremely frustrating and difficult; I could solve the budget deficit quicker than I could put batteries into this unit
 - The instructions are overly complicated; I have to wonder why this is equipped with an electronic lock AND a key
 - It is so compact that it barely holds more than a wallet and cell phone
 - The security cable is kind of flimsy

Call quality:
For one thing, Skype is not good with wireless. This is true of all wireless phones, so I can't blame Netgear in particular: there are just a lot of dropped calls (and I mean, a LOT), and there is definitely a lot of static on the line, so ""Can you hear me?"" will become your new speech tick.
Battery life:
This proved to be an issue using the phone for the office. We don't want to be tied to the computer, but I don't want to NOT be able to answer the phone because the phone is recharging. For this, I give Netgear super low marks. They should've known better.
Usability:
I guess it's OK. The look and feel of the device is very plastic/gimicky, and the size is relatively small. This was a minor issue to dial numbers, as my fingers are much larger than those of a teenage girl. I hate pressing buttons with the very tip of my fingers, which I had to do.

I need to call an 800 number and 3. I don't want to give some one my cell phone (like a business when I order something.  Or the credit card company.)

As far as what I expect a landline telephone to do, it does it.  It was easy to plug in my router.  It makes calls.  It rings.

Yeah, about the ringing.  It comes in two volumes, really super annoyingly loud, and loud.  Those are your two options (besides having it not ring it all, which, sometimes I need to have people call me back or what not so it's not really an option).  I have a very tiny apartment, so maybe that's the reason it sounds so loud.  But the ""low"" setting... it's loud.  I thought changing the ring-tone might help.  That I could find one at the low/load level that at least SOUNDED less obtrusive.  Look, I know it's a landline and there is a limit to the ringtones it can do.  But, while the original ringtone is annoying enough, the demented minds behind the low/loud ringtone have come up with the most annoying sounds I've ever heard.  Each is worse than the last.  I recommend buying this phone to listen to how laughably annoying they think you want your ""low"" ringtone to be. And the keypad is loud too.  I mean, high pitched reminds you of the alarm clock going off annoying and loud kind of noise.  You have the ability to turn the keypad noise off, however.  You want to do that.  Immediately.

The menu is very confusing to navigate.  To get out of a particular sub-menu, you press ""off"".  Odd, as one naturally thinks of a ""back"" or ""clear"" and the ""off"" being the ultimate menu killer, but... okay.

But the super annoying thing I hate is the lack of speakerphone.  As I said, I use this phone if I need to do something like, call a business.  Where I am on hold.  And I don't want to hear the annoying musak up against my ear.  THIS HAS NO SPEAKERPHONE.  I knew this going in from the other reviews, and for the price I thought I didn't really ""need"" a speaker phone.  But, now I miss it.

So, if you're looking for a basic of the basic of the basic phone at the cheapest price you can get, this is it.  It has a small memory, which isn't so terrible as anyone I want to put in it IS on my cell phone anyway.

So, it gets beyond one star because it does it's job.  It's a phone, it rings, it connects, it dials.  The connection is actually pretty clear.  I don't have problems hearing people or static.  You can adjust the volume while talking to people (turn off the annoying keypad first).  So as a phone, it earned it's two stars.

It improves on the R200 in some respects, holds its ground on others, and is a major disappointment in several important ways.

It improves a bit on the R200 in the manner in which it handles disc printing. The tray is more durable, and no longer protrudes from the back of the printer while moving in and out. The visible guides are better, and the loading path is improved.

But a small lever, which raises and lowers the disc tray, is something of a noisy annoyance. Whenever the tray is adjusted, the printer can be heard making a mechanical adjustment inside, and this takes a few seconds. If you insert the disc tray too soon, bad things happen... And, in a puzzling software choice, if you try to print on paper while the tray is down, instead of caching the print job until the tray is raised (like the earlier model), now the job gets deleted and you have to print from your application again after raising the tray. Likewise, if you try to print a disc when the tray is up, the job evaporates and you must print again once the tray is lowered. This is really annoying. I used to stack up jobs onto various media, and then just adjust the tray as necessary once each job finished. That's not possible with this printer.

This printer holds ground in the print quality, which is excellent, but not noticeably different from the earlier printer (neither better nor worse), despite a bunch of marketing noise about print quality improvements. The driver software also combines the settings for regular paper and bright white paper. This is a bad idea which leads to slightly faded and over-saturated prints on regular paper, but no noticeable improvement on bright white paper.

Also, the driver still makes the user select between text-only, text-with-graphics, and the various photo modes. This is cumbersome. The driver should be able to tell if a document is all text or a combination of text and graphics. Offering selections for relative photo quality is fine, but the other options are unintuitive and unnecessary. The driver also still whines about printing borderless photos. If your printer claims to be able to do this, don't make your user click through dialog boxes containing warnings about reduced print quality at the edges.

The printer is much worse than its predecessor in three key areas.

First, it's much larger. You will need much more room on your desktop than with the earlier models. I can see no reason why it needs to be bigger.

Second, it's much noisier. All of the print modes are loud, and the paper feeding mechanism is especially loud. This is partly because the case is mostly hollow and acts like a drum, amplifying the sound of every moving part.

Third, and most disappointing, this model sucks down ink at a much faster rate than its predecessor. One would think that, after losing a class action lawsuit over ink handling issues, Epson would have made some changes. But whatever changes were made only make it worse.

Unlike earlier models, this printer seems to go through cleaning/warm-up cycles much more frequently, even if the printer is left on and no clean-up is requested. I'm routinely shocked to see ink levels in all colors drop by large margins when simply printing black text disc labels. This is completely unacceptable.

A key thing to notice is that it uses colored inks even when printing only black. I don't know if the color cartridges are used in combination with the black cartridge, or if ink is simply passing through them for some other reason. Either way, it's very, very bad -- and very, very expensive.

I had a full set of cartridges on hand when my R200 died, and simply exchanged them for cartridges for this printer. The price was exactly the same. Yet the new printer seems to go through the ink much, much faster. And, like earlier models, it's still impossible to continue printing if even one of the color cartridges is empty. That's just unacceptable after all the complaints users have lodged about this issue.

Overall, I'm disappointed. It works as advertised, but my costs per disc have gone up when they really should have gone down. And the quiet of my studio is often rudely interrupted by the noise this printer makes. It's unlikely that I'll stick with this printer as long as the last one. Epson is shooting themselves in the foot with high ink consumption and high ink prices. Short term, it will make more money. But long term, it will lose customers and all the money they might have given them.

**UPDATE**

I've now had this printer for six months, using it almost every single day. I've printed hundreds of DVDs (the only reason I bought it). My disappointment continues to grow.

There are numerous new bugs in the driver, including inexplicable spinning and whirring inside the printer (an extremely loud process which can take five minutes or more to clear), flashing red lights with no apparent problem (which clear themselves with a power down cycle), rejecting the second disc when printing more than one copy of the same thing (requiring a power down and manual clearing of the print queue), strange pop-up balloon messages in the system tray (coming from the driver itself), and others too weird to document.

I did discover that you can turn off the print monitor and it will stop jumping in front of all your applications. This also regains the ability to stack up jobs on various media then adjust the printer right before each one starts. But by doing this you lose the ability to see which ink cartridges are low. And if one of them runs out while the printer monitor is off, good luck figuring out which one it is. (Hint: You can get to it through the control panel.)

Note that these are all SOFTWARE related problems. Hardware-wise, I haven't really had many problems. I do get many more clogged nozzles with this technology than with the previous type, and have to clean more often (which, annoyingly, cannot be done if one of the ink cartridges is low). It's really no longer possible to use a cartridge until it is actually empty -- just another way that this printer turns out to be a money-grubber.

But over time, it has turned out that actual costs aren't as substantially increased as I originally feared. My original guess would have been about a 25-30% increase. In actuality it's only about 10-15% more expensive. That's still terrible, but not as terrible as I originally feared. (And be prepared to have at least one red light -- the ""ink low"" indicator -- flashing at all times. It rarely goes out because it's hardly ever the case that none of the cartridges are low.)

I do also print invoices, mailing labels (with bar codes) and receipts using this printer. It's a good thing I have a separate laser printer for letters and other documents which need to look really good because, while photo quality is comparable to its predecessor, the text production is substantially worse (albeit much faster). Rarely do I get a document without some row of text being blurry.

Though I didn't mention it originally, it should be noted that the Epson PrintCD software hasn't had an upgrade of any sort with this printer. It's still every bit as rudimentary and clumsy as it's always been. On the one hand this is a good thing because I didn't have to learn any new idiosyncrasies. On the other hand, it's far from a full-featured application. It's more like an applet (Paintbrush for disc printing, if you will) which will frustrate even the most patient user. Calling it ""under-powered"" would be a compliment.

And, one final note: Perhaps the biggest disappointment is that disc printing is almost exactly the same speed as with the earlier printer. Faster disc printing would have been on my wish list, and that wish would not have been granted.

Having said all that, it IS cheap. What is so frustrating is that it's SO CLOSE to being a great printer -- maybe 90% of the way there (the R200 was about 98% of the way there). But the little things (and a couple of big things) really weigh it down. You may already know this, but Epson is really the only company making such economical disc printers. That's too bad because I'd drop them in a heartbeat if there were a worthy competitor.

** UPDATE February 2008 **

Alas, this printer died -- and much faster than its predecessor. It was an ungraceful death, much like its life. One day the lights all started flashing and the software reported that all the cartridges were empty. New cartridges were not recognized.

Since it was within a year, I was able under warranty to swap it for a reconditioned replacement unit. But because I couldn't wait the three weeks this took, I had to go out and buy another disc printer right away. After a quick search, I was stuck buying another Epson, the RX595. The disc printing part is identical, but the new model also has a scanner (which actually explains why the line has gotten so large -- they're making them all so that a scanner can simply be stuck on top).

Look for my review of the RX595 soon.","Noisy, Thirsty, Not For Everyone",1180569600,,

I especially love the pink Jotter and have had a number of them, which eventually get lost. So I ordered a few more recently. I was really disappointed when one of them started having trouble ""clicking"" open and closed. I unscrewed the pen and found the inside of the barrel filled with ink. What a mess! I refuse to put it in my purse...just leave it on my desk. It still works, and so far the ink hasn't leaked out of the pen, but I can't click it open and closed easily. It's all gummed up inside. So I ordered another for my purse. Guess what! Now, it's leaking, too! Barrel full of ink. Luckily, it didn't leak out into my purse. Boy, would I have been mad. What gives, Parker? Really disappointed!!! I want to give this pen five stars, and I would if it didn't leak, but as it is, it's a dud.

UPDATE: I contacted Parker, and they very cheerfully offered to replace my two pens. They said their ink refills have a shelf-life and surmised that these pens may have been old. They didn't have any pink pens in stock, so they let me choose an alternate color. I am extremely pleased with the way Parker handled my problem.

UPDATE: 2015: I've discovered that if you store these pens with the colored barrel end UP, they will begin to leak. I surmise that the original seller had the box of pens upside down for a while, which caused the leakage, as there were several of us who had this problem.

Here are the problems I am having with the unit I am returning to Amazon today:

1. The ADF works perfectly, but about 5 to seven pages of every 20 fail to scan. Since I do a lot of scanning, I can't live with this. HP tech support walked me through some reset procedures and then pronounced the unit defective.

2. HP Tech support is unreliable. They promised to exchange it for me but referred me to another department which will not contact me as promised after repeated requests.

3. The paper feed is unreliable, reporting an empty hopper when it is properly filled. This has occurred a number of times and is a small annoyance.

4. The ADF is supposed to handle legal sized originals, but every second page is ignored, requiring multiple passes and manual collation.

5. The printer frequently drops off of my wired network and has to be shut down and restarted, which is a lengthy process. None of my other network printers have this problem.

6. I installed an HP application software update on one of my computers, and that computer has never been able to connect with the printer since.

7. Periodically, the printer shuts itself off completely overnight, as opposed to staying in sleep mode.

If this printer worked properly it would be exactly what I need, so I am quite disappointed. I may try another one like it locally if I'm sure I can return it.

Update:

I did, in fact, return this one (thanks, Amazon, for making that easy) and buy another, locally. Same problems, right down the line. I returned that one, too, and got a Brother MFC-6890CDW.

Customer Reviews and Scoring
At the time of writing this review, I found 6 customer reviews awarding the organizer a 4.2 out of 5 stars.  Most of the reviews have been positive while one reviewer wasn't impressed with the placements of the mesh baskets.  However, she thought it looked okay head on.
Personal Opinion
Overall, I found this to be a product lacking in quality.  While I believe that the price point for this product is good, I honestly believe that the product itself is cheaply made.
When I received the item, both the box and the organizer were dented. The color was exactly what I wanted, a vibrant pink, and that for me was its saving grace from being sent back. Another thing that made it look cheaply made is that the brand tag on the front was glued on crooked. Even though it was only $6.99 I expected it to have looked a little nicer.

I would've bought a more expensive, better name brand one, but it was all that store had in stock that particular day.  Finally, today, I tried it out.

40% of the time that I inserted a document (inside a laminate sheet) into the machine, it didn't ""pick it up & carry it through,"" so that I needed to try AGAIN & AGAIN to feed it (while keeping an eye on the front edge, so it didn't melt in a 3D shape onto the front edge of the document, simply from being near the heating element).  I'm quite experienced in laminating: I believe their feeding system must have a flaw.

Perhaps this 2nd problem was my fault, as I did use 3mil & 4mil laminate with the 5mil heat setting: My results (not always, but 60% of the time) were lumpy.  The front edge (which had been fed into the machine) was the worst, often with sharp 3D shapes, but not only the front... there was also noticeable air pockets & wrinkling between items (which were only normal cardstock thickness).  The results were SO lumpy that my cutter couldn't cut the finished product (I had to resort to scissors) 25% of the time.

Because of the feeding problem, I didn't bother to try the 3mil. heat setting to see if that would reduce waves.

It could be that for ""cold lamination"" process works well: I wouldn't know.

Personally, I also prefer 4mil laminator sheets which are typically stiff and thick (vs. the 3mil. sheets which came with this product, which create such a light laminate that the sheet can still be pretty easily crumpled/ bent/ folded/ chewed through by a pet).

It's delightful to have a more compact machine than my last laser printer - a behemoth. Nice crisp text, and set up was simple plug and play via USB. The printer was recognized without my having to install any software - it probably was included in one of the automatic system updates from the App store.

Normally I don't write reviews this soon after receiving a product, but I wanted to give my feedback specifically on the wireless setup. The enclosed documentation is unbelievably complicated and doesn't work. Fortunately I only tried for about 15 minutes before I gave up and called Brother Support. Their support was excellent. I spent only a few minutes on hold and then a first level technician walked me through setup in about 10-15 minutes. It was not straightforward and I never would have figured it out on my own. I knocked a star off the review because of bumpy wireless installation and need to call support.

A word about wireless printing from iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, etc.) - Airplay is not supported. You need to print via a special Brother app and from my quick look at that, it's not a simple way to print from whatever app you are in. If you are looking for a printer specifically for the ability to print from your iOS device, you may want to research this further.

The printer is silent when not in use but VERY noisy while printing, and it stays noisy for about 20 minutes after printing.

May 1, 2014 Update:

I've reduced the stars on this printer because of the very bad manual feed. It's almost impossible for the paper to load properly in the slot, resulting in slanted printing. I don't use it frequently, but this means some ruined checks. And I cannot print business cards on this printer.

So to summarize -

Pros:
Compact
Good print quality
Cheap
Wireless

Cons:
Very noisy (during and after printing; it's quiet on standby)
Manual feed is all but useless

Color printer:

After 12-15 color copies, the machine gave me an error that it couldn't read the color cartridge. I called tech support and they told me to try a different color cartridge. I told them I was NOT purchasing a new color cartridge to ""see if that was the problem"" and that if they wanted it tested they would have to send me one. They obviously refused and I just quit printing color on this printer period. I still to this day don't know if it's the cartridge or the printer.

Scanning:

The installed software is horrible, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!!!! A single page of paper scanned as black and white text should not exceed 1MB!!!! Nothing I did reduced the size of the scan and after a thorough check on Google, it was stated over and over that it was HP's software that was bloating the file size. I purchased a stand alone Scan-to-PDF program for $20 or so and it worked like a charm. Now I can scan a 15 page document and have it be 1-2 MB.

Faxing:

Okay. Don't do a lot but it does what it says.

Coping:

I scan it to PDF and then print it on my trusty laserjet since I the cartridges can't be read to print anything.

Feeding:

That part works as expected. Occasionally it will jam, but nothing too prohibitive. I like the versatility of either feeding through a bunch of pages or being able to scan the odd-sized piece of whatever.

I tried to download the latest driver from Epson's site, only to discover that it was mistakenly a scanner driver after I wrestled with the fact that the self-extracting archive wouldn't extract. After I contacted Epson no less than six times, a tech confirmed that she couldn't extract it either, and escalated me to a level one tech who said that that file extension needed to be changed to "".app"", which did work. Why does Epson not change it if they know it is a problem? This last time it turned out to be the latest printer driver. The nail in the coffin for this printer is that, for no reason that Epson can explain, it started to crop all of the pics evenly on each side. Nothing I did would prevent it. Epson suggested using Photoshop to increase the size of the pic a small percentage, which is not exactly a pleasant thing to do with the hundreds of pics I print. At bottom, I think the problem is that Mac functionality and support is an afterthought for Epson.

Update: It got worse over time. The printer began to crop the picture by about 1/16 to 1/4 inch on each side, depending on the application printed from. I gave up on it.","With a Mac, not so good",1168905600,11,

What you are getting is a very smal safe that is oddly shaped on the inside.  The safe's inside measurement is roughly (at the largest points) 2-3/4"" x 1.5"".  The odd part is the locking mechanism in the middle of the compartment and two screws on the bottom holding the bottom half on.

The safe only holds money if you fold it very small.  Folding in fourths is not small enough.  Keys depend on size.

The safe material is surprisingly heavy and strong.

The safe has a 3 digit combination (not customizable).  Each dial is 1-6 so if you do probability math the possible combinations are 6x6x6=216.  So it isn't much and can be eventually found through brute force (trying every single combination).

I would say that this is good for geocaching or something meant to act as a small deterrent.  If you use your head and also hide this small safe to add to the security then you will be better off.

Expect to spend an above average amount of time setting up the printer because of all of the steps you must go through to setup an Instant Ink account.  While the Instant Ink is certainly convenient and is projected to save money on ink replacements, it is at the expense of allowing HP to share your information (IP address, printer usage, etc) with undisclosed third parties (read the terms you must agree to in order to use the service).  You also give HP permission to make changes to the printer without your permission.  The Instant Ink is a bonus, but I am giving the printer three stars because as printer, it is only average.

Unpacking and Setup
In the box, you find the printer, a power cable, a telephone cable for the fax, photo paper and two ink cartrages.  The printer also comes with two pamphlets for the setup.  The first is a quick setup guide which uses illustrations to show you how to find all of the packaging you need to remove.  There are also illustrations which show how to assemble the trays which actually a bit confusing.  The second, thicker pamphlet is for troubleshooting network connections and the fax.

Once the printer is free from all of the packaging, you plug in the printer and turn it on.  After specifying the region, date and time are set,  you are prompted to install the ink.  The printer will print a test page.  Next you connect the printer to your wireless router using the network setup wizard on the printer.

The next step is to install drivers on your computer.  The documentation gives a website address where you are prompted to download a file with not only the drives, but lots of HP software.  I don't like adding all of this type of software to my computer so instead, I went to the HP website and after entering the details about my printer, I was sent to a page from which I could download just the drivers.  Setting up the drives was straightforward and I set up the printer on the network.  However, one annoying thing was that the  software would not continue unless I gave personal information such as how I would use the printer and my zip code.  I really don't like it when software forces you to give information rather than letting it be an option.

Next I setup Instant Ink (see the section below)

First Printing
The first time I tried to print, nothing happened.  Printing test pages from printer setup did nothing either.  I attached the printer to my computer directly using a USB cable and that didn't work either.  However, shutting down and restarting the printer did.  So, this may be an important step in the setup.

Instant Ink
The $120 prepaid card for the instant ink was supposed to be attached to some part of the printer.  However, I had to search for it and found it at the bottom of the box.  Although there was a dab of glue on the back of the card, it had come off and it would have been very easy to have thrown the card away with the packaging.  So, be sure that you have the card before you throw anything away.

The Instant Ink prepaid card that comes with this printer and sold by Amazon.com can only be used if you set your region to the US.  So, if you are hoping to buy this printer to use in Canada, for example, you will not be able to use the prepaid card to have ink shipped to your Canadian address.

I enrolled through the website the printer told me to use rather than the software that HP wanted me to download to my computer.  I entered my email address to setup my account.  Based on my email address, the website indicated that I had a Snapfish account that I should use to login.  I had set the Snapfish account up maybe 10 years ago and there was no other way to setup my Instant Ink account other than to request a new password and to go from there.

Once you have setup your account, you enroll in Instant Ink and it is there that you type in the prepaid card number.  You must then choose a plan and then enter a code from your printer.  The website explains how to do this from your internet connected printer.  Note that for this all to work, you must agree to let the printer download updates.  The terms and conditions for the service read that HP can change the software on the printer at any time without your approval.  Lastly, you enter your shipping address and that completes the enrollment.

I am very curious to see how well this Instant Ink program will work.  It will be nice to have ink show up in my letter box when the printer is running low.  However, I probably won't participate again when the credit is used up.  I don't like the idea that my printer is connecting to third party servers and sharing my information.

Controls
The printer has a touch screen that you use to print, copy, scan and fax.  Setup is also controlled using the touchpad.  You can setup your network and fax as well as change your preferences.  For example, you can tell the printer to turn off after two hours of nonuse.

Ports
The printer has a panel on the front that can be opened to access slots for different memory cards as well as a USB port.  On the back of the printer can be found a USB 2.0 Type B port, an Ethernet port and a phone line port (for the fax).  The printer also supports NFC Touch-to-Print.

Sounds
By default the printer will play a sound when a print job is complete.  The printer will also play a sound in the middle of the night if it receives an update.  The volume of the sound can be controlled in the settings.

The printer produces the typically ink jet sounds when printing as the head moves back and forth.  I would say that the HP printer produces an average sound level for ink jet printers.

Speed and Quality
The HP 5741 is not the fastest printer available, but unless you are printing a lot or in a rush, the speed will probably be acceptable.  The quality of the document printing is also completely acceptable.  Photos and graphics print ok, but probably below average for an inkjet printer.

Overall
The HP OfficeJet 5741 is an average printer with the novel addition of the Instant Ink.  The print quality and speed are fine for most home applications.  If you are in the market for a multi function inkjet and you are looking for the convenience of having ink sent to you when you need it, then this printer should be considered.","A competent but average ink jet printer with the convenience of Instant Ink but, at the expense of your personal information",1456617600,2,

I thought I have found the last mechanical pencil I would ever need once my Pentel Kerry broke after 12 years. I work in estimating  and use a mechanical pencil every day and was bummed when my Kerry broke.

So I after research bought the 800 which is pricey but is top of the line mechanical pencil or so I thought. On the plus side it is a very well made metal mechanical with great lines and is exceptionally designed/engineered . Has great looks and a very nice black, non-slip coating, brass highlites, is heavy but well balanced and knurling on the grip and top twist mechanism. The retraction mechanism so far has worked flawlessly. It just feels great in the hand and got a lot of compliments about it in work meetings.

On the downside - the lead keeps freaking breaking inside the barrel!! No matter how gently I write (we're talking about a +$50 pencil here) the lead breaks. I can't keep going through replacement leads all the time as the 800 keeps eating them like a dog on a steak and I've only had it for one week for crying out loud. The knurling while very functional is not raised very much and dust/dirt, skin, eraser particles, etc. just get clogged in it which makes it look dirty all the time (maybe the silver model would be better?). Has a very small eraser which I don't use anyway but tiny none the less.

It's a great pencil and I loved writing with it but sent it back due to the issues I had. Maybe others will have a better constructed pencil than I had and will not experience the lead breaking or not be bothered by it. All in all I cannot recommend this model - the 800/0.5mm black.
So now I'm on the search again for a well made mechanical pencil. Maybe the 800 silver model or the 800/0.7mm will not have the same issues or possibly the 600. I don't know but with the reviews on those models I will check them out before I give up on Rotring.",Rotring 800 - Disappointed in lead constantly breaking!,1412035200,,

I've had to clear the desk it sits above a couple of times of ""corkboard crumbles"".

There is a pen attached to the side.  This is handy, but the holder it's in is hard to get it out of.  I guess there's no worry of losing it though!  And it is nice that it's there when you need it.  The pen even has its own eraser on the tip and it erases off the whiteboard quite well.  The last feature of this board would be that there are already hangers on it.  So it's ready to hang when you get it.

I'm sure this would be a lot more handy for parents, or people who may use it for other uses than I do.  It's small but has enough room for small lists and is good for little reminders.

Adhering the first side to the sheet was easy, getting the sheet to stick on top with smooth edges was a little trickier.

And then of course if you get other envelopes or whatever too close when this stuff is drying, they stick together.  The lick and stick is ok in a pinch but I've found something that works better.  I've since started using double-sided tape like Scor-Pal's Scor-Tape http://www.amazon.com/Scor-Pal-SP202-Scor-Tape-0-25-27-Yard/dp/B001RQ55ZQ/ when making envelopes for notecards - just cut off however much tape you want to use, apply to the envelope flap and leave the tape backing still attached on the other side of the tape.  When closing the envelope, the user simply peels the backing off the Scor-Tape and closes the envelope.  For little thank you notecards that don't go through the mail, you only need half an inch to an inch to keep the flap closed, so that's an economical way to make envelopes when you don't want to stick it closed immediately.  And when making envelopes for a classroom of valentines day cards or whatever, the time saved is considerable over the lick and stick glue - you don't need to wait for the glue to dry, just slap a little piece of tape.

While it suffers from the same terrible HP rating system it does perform far superior to that of the 901 standard black and will save you $ in the end if you print a lot of black.

This cartridge is rated for 700 pages before running out, but that rating is very misleading.  From my research, HP rates their cartridge off the ISO standard high-yield page, not off every day use or pictures.  They also use a J4580 printer which is an INK SAVER printer.  Because of this the cartridges used in printers other than a J4580 can get random results.  I owned 2 black standard 901's and both gave completely different results probably due to the amount of black ink on the pages I was printing.

Example: Cartridge B prints nothing but black Bars... Cartridge A prints nothing but text documents.  B only can do 110 pages while A does almost 215.

The same example holds true to the XL cartridge. Depending on how dense the black is on the page and your Print Quality you might never even see 400 pages with an XL cartridge.  I tend to print on FAST/economy for almost everything except if it is an important document.  Doing so the 901XL has lasted me well over 500 pages (one ream of paper) and still shows as 50% full.  Still despite my success with the 901XL I could of easily printed 300 pages of bar graphs(Black and White) on FAST/Economy and been out of ink already.

With that said I have to give this cartridge 3 stars.  It gives you far more bang for you $ when you compare it to the standard 901 black, as ONE 901XL has lasted me twice as long as two 901 standards did combined.  However do not trust the 700 page rating as it only will hold true under certain circumstances.

I number each slide, so can find them quickly in case I need a better quality scan with a ""real"" scanner - This unit doesn't scan, it takes a digital picture of the slide. The speed is impressive and the functionality (turn a picture on the screen with a push of a button) is good. The reason why I can only give 3 points is, that the German 35mm slides don't fit. The trays have tiny plastic frames for each slide. The width of the frame was okay, but the height was to small so I couldn't fit the slides in and close the tray. I ended up using a Dremel to remove one side of the plastic edge of each frame in one of the trays. That way I could fit the slides in and get started.

This seems to be an HP issue as the printer will only read HP new cartridges and errors on old cartridges. You are supposed to be able to just hit the OK button and the printer is supposed to go on printing until the ink levels drop and quality begins to suffer so you know to change the cartridge. I wish that were so... I could deal with that but, it kept on erroring and stopping the print process. I will not buy remanufactured cartridges because of this one issue. I have to print a lot from my laptop in another room and often receive faxes while at work so babysitting a printer is not an option.

- Uninstalled and reinstalled all the software that came with the printer
- Disabled Wireless LAN DRX and IPv6 networking in the printer network settings
- Added a network location via the web gui (accessed by typing the ip of the printer into your web browser

- Re-configured the wireless settings on the printer using the manual configuration including re-entering the wireless password

These XL inks definitely last longer than the std versions that shipped with the printer, and yellow always seems to go first.  But they work as advertised, and never last as long as you want them to.  We've had our printer for 2 years and replaced inks once a year now.

The colors seem to pop when using the special 4x6 papers and drying time is very fast.  I haven't seen any fading in pictures that were printed 2 yrs ago with these inks, and they are advertised to not fade, so i guess its working as advertised.",Ink is the necessary evil,1264809600,3,

Also, Canon has combined the color into one cartridge with this model, which costs more to replace instead of individual ones for blue, yellow, red, etc... (on other models you just replace the one that ran out, not the rest.) There is also no rear document feeder on this printer as there is with other Canons. Can't really fault them I guess since this is an entry-level printer, but for these reasons I can't rate higher than 3.5 stars.
Print quality & speed are decent with the 3120.

Other Canon printers have widely available cartridges from aftermarket & Amazon fulfillment sellers here and the price & quality is great. The money you save on this printer will be entirely lost the first time you buy ink.

I highly recommend checking out the Canon MG5320, its the best printer I've ever owned-when it breaks I'm getting another. I own this model as well as the one I'm reviewing & the 5320 is a stellar printer for around $100. Amazingly fast, easy to use display, and prints photos fast & quality you won't believe even with the aftermarket ink. I spend $10-15 for a nice complete set of aftermarket cartridges and I'm set.

Inside the notebook are 64 pages, each with room for six URLs, along with usernames and passwords.  It's small enough to keep in a purse or jacket pocket, or to tuck away in a drawer for safekeeping.

OK, this is a good idea.  Like most people, I have TONS of online accounts that require log in info, and unless I use the same usernames and passwords for all of them (not a good idea!), it's a real struggle to keep track of everything.  So I thought a little booklet like this would be a good way to stay organized.  Well, it would be, if there were also spaces for all those ""security questions"" I have to keep track of for all my accounts.  Over the years, I've found that I tend to forget exactly how I answered some of those questions (i.e. ""Name of your best friend from high school,"" or ""Street where you lived in sixth grade"" - those sound easy enough, but did I use ""Beth"" or ""Elizabeth"" or ""Bethy,"" and did I say ""Franklin Street"" or ""Franklin St"" or just ""Franklin""?).  I was hoping this little notebook would provide room for the questions and answers, which can be harder to keep track of than the usernames and passwords.  And since many financial advisors have suggested that we should not answer those security questions with real answers, but instead make up phony ones, it's even more important to have a place to keep track of them.

Overall, this is a nice little notebook to keep track of usernames and passwords.  It should have a more sturdy cover, though, so it doesn't end up falling apart after a few years of usage.  It also needs room for those security questions and answers.  I will use this, but I'll adapt it to include that security info - which means I'll be using it as if it were just a notebook full of blank paper.

I used it to scan the folks' photo albums but it took a lot of time to fix the photos afterwards on a computer.

Pro's:
*  This model has rollers on both the leading and trailing edges, an improvement over the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VuPoint-Solutions-Magic-Wand-Portable-Scanner-PDS-ST415-WM/dp/B004EFXW6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VuPoint Solutions Magic Wand Portable Scanner (PDS ST415 WM)</a>, although apparently manufactured by the same company.

Cons:
*  More bulky than the VuPoint, and only available in green.
*  There is about 1"" of dead space on each side of the scanner that is not scanned, which may be an issue when scanning a page from a book, i.e. if the left margin is less than an inch.
*  Disposable Alkaline batteries are supposedly required; I used NiMH rechargeables and they worked OK but were drained after about 100 scans.
*  The unit randomly locks up when batteries are weak.
*  There is no crop feature (even if the background is entirely white or black), so the resulting scanned image is always 8.5"" wide, requiring use of computer software to crop them down to the desired size (say 4x6"").
*  Scanned images were always a tad crooked (compared to a flat-bed scanner), also requiring computer software to rotate them into position if desired.  Manually rotating and cropping each photo wastes a lot of time.
*  Scanned images were also intermittently distorted depending on how quickly the scanner was moved across the photo, for example after scanning a photo of a person, sometimes their head might appear ""squished"" if the scanner was moved faster over their head in the photo (possibly the scanner ""lost"" some scan lines without illuminating the ""error"" light, or possibly the distortion occurred when the edge of the photo hit the second roller).  In any case I was a bit upset that some of the photos were distorted as in a Fun-House Mirror.
*  The JPG files that were output had about 2KB of extra padding at the end of each file, confusing and locking up some photo viewer programs.  For example, gimp (GNU Image Manipulation Program) said that all JPG files were corrupt due to this extra padding, and linux's default ""Image Viewer"" program locked up.
*  Max resolution of 600dpi is not as high as the VuPoint Solutions Magic Wand Portable Scanner model PDS-ST415-VPS (which does 900dpi)
*  The resolution is not remembered across power-cycles, so must be reconfigured each time the unit is powered on (unless you always want to scan at the lowest resolution).
*  This model also does not support PDF file output, whereas the VuPoint Solutions Magic Wand Portable Scanner model PDS-ST415-VPS model does.  (Note that the VuPoint PDS-ST415-VP model doesn't support PDF output and is also 600dpi like this Wolverine model; watch for that last letter in the model number!)","Randomly locks up when batteries are weak, distorted images",1335916800,168,

The wireless is far from intuitive and not at all reliable; my successful printing has thus far lal been wired.  I don't like not having separate ink cartridges for each color because it makes for additional waste, and it seems these ink cartridges cannot be refilled at any of the big office stores which is another environmentally unfriendly element.  The scanner works fine, but the way it saves multi-page documents is a pain, and again, not intuitive.  All in all a decent printer, but I actually prefer my older model because it was a lot easier to set up out of the box.

1.  Print quality is excellent for a ink jet printer.
2.  Printer cartridges that are provided with the printer do not last long.
3.  Printer cartridges cannot be refilled at big office stores.
4.  Printer cartridges are pricey to replace and no big box brand is compatible.
5.  Document feeder is good for copy/fax/scanning function.

A lot of the weight is towards one end of the pen, making it a bit awkward in the hand.  It writes well, though, with a nice flow of ink, it doesn't skip, but the ink does tend to spread a bit on certain kinds of paper, making your writing significantly thicker than you'd typically want it.  The black ink is a nice, deep black and not a washed-out grayish as some rollerball inks are.  It also dries fairly quickly, which cuts down on the risk of smearing.  I don't know how well lefties fare with this pen, but as a righty, it does the job.

The finish of the pen doesn't seem to hold up real well, unfortunately.  Although it's lacquered, it still scratches pretty easily.  The chrome pieces are nice, giving it a kind of ""tuxedo"" look to it, and while I was still using it, I did receive a few compliments on it.

It works extremely well for my purposes.

I was able to program the entire key code process for my work,voice mail, including pauses. (I think they are the * Button?) However it was the most numbers allowed for the speed dial, which was about 20 characters, which may not be enough for everyone- For me, I preferred entering my passcode myself, so that the speed dialer doesn't override my security, but that may not work for others.)

For a phone in a smaller office, it works well as a personal speaker phone. It probably wouldn't work well for a larger group or room, although people can hear my cuckoo clock from across the house when on speaker. (A nice icebreaker for those conference calls)The mute button does make a noise, and it is a bit annoying to have to unmute to tell someone the beep was to mute the phone, and to ignore it. (All speakerphones, it seems, work well when you mute the caller when not talking. I don't know any that deal well with ambient noise)

I've recently switched to a different web-phone provider (much cheaper, you buy a box, and through the 'net', you can 'talk' with phone service for a year) The phone does not play well with this item. I have to reset it daily when I start work, and my pre-programmed numbers, with pauses, tend to not connect in time for the next keystrokes to be recognized. This is the fault of the phone service provider, I am sure, but it bears mentioning for others with similar setups. (My Cable company provided phone had no problem with this) I've read that this brand doesn't work well with that service, but I have pretty good call quality otherwise.

In the past year, I have had to change the batteries to the caller ID unit only once.

I have done this many times for family and friends on both Mac and Windows platforms, but this device required multiple attempts and the better part of three hours to get it up and running.

This color of ink is somewhere between orange and brown as is shown in the product information rendered in my monitor. I need and want a ""bulletproof"" or ""eternal"" orange ink so I gave it a try. I had created a similar color myself with a 3-parts Noodler's Yellow to 1-part Noodler's Fox ink mixture.

As others have noted, the drawer on the side slides out when the desk is moved.  A small nuisance but silly and easily fixable if the manufacturer had made an effort.  Also, the angled part of the desk does not snap in or up so you have to be careful when moving or it will swing out hit you (a heavy piece of bamboo) or slam down on your hand.  The legs also do not snap in when carrying it and swing out and are very heavy.  The only way to carry it so neither the top or the legs are swinging out due to gravity is if it was under your arm and you used your hand or body to hold everything in place.  I would not recommend for small children for this reason as it could easily injure someone.

I also found the angled portion of the desk was to extreme for typing comfortably.  The tiny wooden ledge is an awkward depth and hits the wrist uncomfortably.  For reading it might be okay, but the desk is so big that I can imagine using it just a lap reading tray, and the angled part isn't wide enough for a textbook.  The wood was apparently not precisely cut either, as the seems do not meet perfectly, creating a slight gap and uneven surface.  The ""cup holder"" is totally useless and amounts to another annoying uneven surface when you're using the desk for writing.

That said, I did use this desk a lot (and hence the three stars) but only as a basic flat desk.  I used in bed but not on my couch (too large).  I didn't use the drawer or the angled stand.  Without these features, and the fact that neither the legs, drawer, or angled stand lock in place limiting portability, this desk is not worth the nearly $50 I paid.  It's heaviness is a hazard rather than an asset.

The three movable tabbed dividers to separate subjects are an excellent idea. The dividers are color-coded, even, so that it's easy to remember which subject is where. As every student knows, some subjects end up having acres of notes while others don't require much; it really depends on the class and the teacher's use of handouts. Thus movable dividers are brilliant.

The pages are college ruled and it's great they are pre-punched with three holes for easy transfer to a binder if necessary.

While the covers and the dividers themselves are very sturdy, the folders or pockets attached to the dividers are pretty flimsy, and unequal to the task of holding a lot of handouts. They will also rip easily and won't be in good shape by the end of a semester.

Paper quality is on the thin side, but that's par for the course with school notebooks. While I like how the spiral spine is covered in cloth (they call it a Spiral Guard) to prevented dreaded snags, the stitching is weak and sloppy. The stitches are very loosely spaced. Further use (just carrying the notebook around) will certainly cause more stitches to loosen.

In the end, it's up to you whether the excellent positives (dividers, pre-punched perforated pages) outweigh the drawbacks (corners cut on the stitching of the Spiral Guard, flimsy pockets on the dividers).","great dividers, not-so-great stitching on the Spiral Guard,",1438041600,,

When I chose this item, I was thinking that it would be nice to reclaim a bit of my desk space by having room underneath the monitor to store more clutter.  But overall, my impression is mixed.  It does what it's meant to do, but I didn't feel like it was a step up from my current configuration.

In terms of design, the black molded plastic is OK, but the milky plastic overlay that covers the support structure looks and feels somewhat cheap.  It comes with additional rubber feet you can use to adjust the height of the stand, but I didn't use them as it would have made the monitor a whole lot higher than it currently is.  The unit comes with ""directions"" on how to assemble it, but I certainly had problems making heads or tails of what they were trying to convey.  Granted, I don't think you *need* directions to use this, but the pictures-only instructions did more to confuse than clarify.

My biggest issue was the footprint of the stand.  Since I had my monitor set back to the edge of the desk, I really didn't want to bring it forward much.  But given the way the three legs of the stand flare out, you can pretty much figure that the monitor will end up somewhat closer to your face than you previously had it.  Furthermore, it's much wider and deeper than my current monitor base, so some things had to be spread out a bit more than they had been before.  Granted, you get some of that space back under the monitor, but things like speakers and such will end up in different places.  When I stood back to look at how things had to be placed to make it work, I wasn't thrilled with the arrangement, and went back to my previous layout.

Obviously, your mileage will vary based on what you have on your desk, whether you need your monitor to be higher than it currently is, etc.  But at least for me, this riser didn't offer enough advantages to cause me to stick with it.

It's a sensible, lightweight document tube. It would be a good buy at $20 or 3 for $35.

It's made from inexpensive plastic, probably HD polyethylene.

PROs:

 - Adjustable length
 - Adjustable handle and strap work pretty well

OKs:

 - Not very waterproof. Lots of gap where the halves fit together.

CONs:

 * Overpriced (when over $20)

NIT PICKs:

 - The cap threads are feeble. You can just pull the cap off if you don't feel like unscrewing it.
 - Foul odor inside the tube
 - The screw fastening strap-to-cap was overtightened. Prevented cap from unscrewing .

- - - Measurements and Corrections - - -

 - Rolled documents up to 3.0 inches diameter will slide easily in and out of the tube.
 - At the highest 49"" mark, you can fit 50"" rolls inside the tube.
 - You can extend one notch further for 52"" documents if necessary.
 - Product dimensions (collapsed) 30.75"" x 4.25"" x 5.75""

As you can see from my original review I was a little wary of the magnets staying on the key itself with the adhesive especially with the beating keys get in a day to day life.  I had 5 keys stuck together (2 home, 2 cars, 1 gym key) and now there are only 3 stuck together because the some of the magnets have fallen off over time and are lost. If the adhesive had been much stronger, they may be able to last significantly longer.

Original review: This is a fabulous little key organizer as I needed something to keep my keys a little quieter when I hooked them to the outside of my gym bag or purse.  It was just really annoying to hear with each footstep ""JANGLE! JANGLE""!  So thought I would try these magnetic key helpers I had seen once at a local store.  The magnets were easy to snap out of the product packaging and easily slipped on each key.  I made sure that I had a positive labeled magnet facing the negative labeled one.  The stickers came off easily without leaving adhesive behind and the magnets were stronger than what I thought for being so little.  I gave it the final test of shaking it up and down and all the keys stuck together like they should!  I will definitely have quieter footsteps now on my way to and from the gym!",Jangle Jangle to Quiet,1456963200,,

The desk is centered around the middle and the center has an elevated desk top with three storage slots beneath. There are not many desks that have this heightened center and this one caught my eye with the colors and storage options.

At the time I used this desk I had a second computer stored in that cubby with the monitor for that computer directly above it. The center was my gaming PC and this was a pretty awesome desk for gaming, unfortunately I was forced to have aluminum mouse pads because the surfaces are uneven where they attach. For the price this was definitely the major downside (besides being particle board but that's just the standard now) and I am not fond of aluminum mice. Hard plastic game pads would bend because of the angle and that frustrated me to no end (mouse sliding and what not).

I had to drill holes in the back of the storage slots so I could adequately route my wires. I definitely think holes factory installed for cable routing would have been a smart thing to add but unfortunately I had to drill into crappy particle board (so no matter what it is going to be an ugly hole).

Overall this is a pretty good desk for particle board but I do not think it was worth the price.

I have my TWO single keys on it, which not heavy at all--and the lanyard keeps falling right off of my neck!!  Without even touching it! I was literally just sitting at my desk and it fell off. It also fell off twice as I was walking, too--again--not even touching it!!

1. The elastic band is anchored to the back cover with metal rivets/anchors, which creates a non-flat back cover.  There are two distinct bulges when trying to write on the right side of the notebook, which will become more and more noticeable as you get to the end of the notebook.  But there are issues with getting to the end of the notebook, because...

2. The notebook doesn't lay flat.  The notebook features a good number of pages, but requires a hand to hold the notebook in-place if you plan on writing lengthy entries.  I imagine if this was used as a random thoughts notebook instead of a journal, it will be better.

3. The paper is pretty awesome -- smooth and thick, with no bleed through or ghosting even for fountain pens.  But wet inks do not dry quickly on this paper, so you'll need to keep the book open or have a separate sheet inside to shield the opposite side of the notebook to dry the ink.

Overall, the notebook is fine.  It is pretty sturdy for being a softcover, and the paper is of really high quality.  I'd just temper my expectations to use this as a long-term journal.  If Clairefontaine can offer this in blank pages rather than college ruled, I think that'd expand the usability of these will increase.","Great paper, but some issues with usability and structure that make this notebook difficult to use",1460332800,18,

The single supporting round tube set and twist friction lock are not bad but not great. It is sturdier and less wobbly than I expected but it's still not all that solid.

The placement of the fan and LED light are good for my laptop and the size is large about for the 17"" dell precision. It's a little tight for using a mouse beside the laptop or having room to place papers.

The feet/castors are plastic and so is the locking hinge mechanism under the top. The may be perfectly fine but don't give a sense of quality. On the other hand it's not all that expensive. I guess you get what you pay for.

One thing that was very annoying was the tool included (in the desktop drawer of you need to find it) is the allen wrench/phillips head screwdriver. Finding it wasn't annoying. What was is that it does not fit the bolts it's supposed to tightened holding the base on and the philips head end was poorly made. Luckily I had an allen wrench that fit and a reasonably phillips head screwdriver for the 2 bolts and 3 screws needed to hold it all together.

Update: Dec 4, 2013
It hasn't been very long and I already see the edge of the top wood-grain plastic is starting to separate. The top looked nice when I got it but I don't think it will keep looking good for much longer. Not too surprising.

I have stopped using the fan and light. It's a good idea and might be good in the summer, but blowing the cool air down on my legs just isn't comfortable for me in the winter. I keep my home cool (65f) which I find comfortable but that's without a ""breeze"" cooling me down more! The LED light might be nice if I were doing paperwork, but it isn't helpful to me with my laptop. It just stays tucked into it's little slot.

After living with this for a while now I think it's OK but not a great value. It's sturdy enough and functional, but the fan and light sounded better than they turned out to be and the finish on the top seems like it will not be very durable.

I've read a few reviews and i guess some came with creases and folds and stuff which i find, well hard to believe lol.  It's wrapped in clear plastic and behind the magnetic part is a pretty hard cardboard backing that doesn't allow it to flex at all.  Plus the way amazon ships it in a large box which insures it arrived in the way it was shipped.  Why i'm giving it 4 stars which means i like it, is because at work we all are in cube farms.  You know,  the type that has some sort of cloth color panels and the edges are about 1 1/2 inch of metal on the edges.  Well i got this so it will stick to the top edge of my cube so that i can write things i'm doing that week, if i'm in meetings,  if i'm helping some other person at their cube and so forth.  But that 1 1/2"" edge at the top of my cube was enough to hold the whole magnet up at the top edge of my cubicle lol.  So the magnet is pretty strong.  If you have a metal cabinet or something,  it's gonna stick very well to it lol.  I bought some expo dry erase thin markers that come with the expo eraser and some fluid to help if it doesn't come off.  These have been working well with it so far and i primarily discarded that cheap marker that came with it as i'm pretty sure it's not the same quality as the expo pens.  You do see some left over color, very slight as i'm sure the plasticky top isn't as good as a real dry erase whiteboard, but does come off with expo's whiteboard cleaner.  But i'm thinking if i have to use all this  and wipe this plastic top, i'm sure i'm going to put undue wear on it causing the ink to soak in more.  Also it was on the smaller size as far as calendars go,  i didn't want one of those huge desk top tear off calendars.  And it has like 3 lines in each square which doesn't leave much room to write stuff, so if you need to write large messages then this isn't for you lol.  It's made for like  ""in cube 4032""  or  ""in meeting room 502""  or  ""At dentist, be back at 5pm"" ,  or at home you can post stuff like  ""greg clean your room today""  or  ""peanut butter getting low""  or ""pick up shelly after volleyball""  you get the idea lol.

Update:  i'm still using the smaller expo dry erase pack that came with eraser and fluid.  a coworker wrote on my board with a red bic dry erase and that just doesn't come off.  It sort of came off when i wrote over it with a red expo marker and then erased it.  I can still see what i wrote, but it's much fainter.

I'm a big fan of scanning lots of documents to file away, and having them become Searchable PDFs.  The software included with this package DOES NOT have support for this.

You can get it to do OCR and export it into a Word Document, but that in no way saves the original look of the document.

You can save as a .pdf, but it's only a pdf image with no word searching capability.

The OmniPage software included is only a limited version.  The software in it would allow you to create searchable PDFs but you have to buy the full version for $149.

What's the point of creating a PDF document if you can't search the words in it?  This is a very basic functionality, that due to be left out makes its scanning capability extremely lacking and that's why I take two stars off of it.",No Searchable PDF built in and low Toner Life?!,1213747200,17,

Anyone who spends a lot of time with a laptop while sitting on a couch and is bothered by the laptop's heat or wishes that there was a more ergonomically correct way may want to consider this product.

And 'laptop stand' isn't the only possible use. I can see using CAAZORII's to hold a cookbook off the table, easier to read and protected from accidental spills or whatnot. Or as an improvised tabletop-sitting lectern. I'm sure there are many more practical uses.

I am in fact writing this review on my laptop while sitting on the couch and, indeed, the CAAZORII makes it possible to do it and makes a trip to the desk unnecessary. Once the Lapdesk is in place with the laptop on top of it it's quite comfortable for as long as I stand still. If I had to use the laptop on and off this would not be a practical solution because, as comfortable the use may be while settled, the initial setup and the disentanglement are not quick or easy - take the laptop off Lapdesk while the Lapdesk is still on the couch with me sitting on it, then take the Lapdesk from under me and make sure that I don't get scratched by the undercarriage protrusions, then find some place for the Lapdesk to stand until the next laptop-use-on-the-couch session... Now, that I've been working on this review for the past 15 minutes or so I feel like I wanted to stretch my legs but I won't because I'd have to do what I just described above and then do it again in reverse when ready to resume.

By the way, I am writing this review because the makers of this product - Made in USA - offered to send me a free unit and I agreed to give it a test drive. In other words, I didn't pay for it but I didn't promise a 'good review' and the makers of CAAZORII didn't ask or even imply that they expected one.

If I was to organize my thoughts, this is what I like about this product:

- addresses the laptop heat problem
- enforces a better posture
- many possible uses other than 'laptop stand'
- easy to assemble and carry
- 4 distinct configurations are possible
- made in the USA

The not so good aspects are:

- protrusions underneath the platform make use less comfortable that it should be
- anyone with, let's say, thicker than average thighs may not be able to use this product
- not a good solution if you are going to use your laptop on and off

I will not comment on 'price' because prices change and because I understand that innovation deserves to be rewarded and, as a car salesperson told me once, the price is right if I (the individual buyer) decide it is so because the product fulfills my needs or expectations.

I believe that 3 stars should be the fair rating for this product. Three stars stand for ""It's Okay"" on Amazon's rating scale (4 stars are for ""I like it"" and 5 stars are for ""I love it"").",Taking the laptops off our laps,1336780800,9,

They look like a little thing your kids would try to sucker you in to at the school book fair for $5 or less, only in that case, at least some of it would go to the school... It is in a thin plastic hang sleeve bag and one of mine tore in shipping. I bought these as a gift, so the pen tearing out of the cheap plastic bag/sleeve, was a bad start. The backing is your bookmark, decent print quality, but it is exactly like a cardboard/card-stock backing that you could use for a bookmark...

The pen is like a Bic pen, I kid you not, Like those sets of 10 pens with the white barrel and the black or blue tips and bottom so you know what color you are writing with that you can often get a pack of for $1 around back to school time.... Now Bic pens write nicely enough and are quality budget pens, but these ""wands"" set me back like $9 a piece, so I really don't want the weight and quality of a 10-20 cent pen.... The cap is more heavy weight and does a good impression of the wand handle, and really the only part of this that seems like it could be worth the price if the rest were not so cheap. I guess the only upside is, I am betting I can switch out the guts when she uses these pens up so she can keep using her pens. Similarities to the BICs should come in handy some how....

The pens were okay, but I would not buy them again at anything over $5, and even at $5 I may still hesitate. So spending $18 on two of them was really disappointing....

I scanned some old 135mm slides and the results varied, but I think that's just because the slides weren't really stored properly.  Some came out really washed out and yellowed, while others were vibrant and colorful.  The edges of the slides showed up in my digital scans, which looks pretty cool - if you plan to reprint your images, you might have to do some cropping.

You can adjust the colors and image settings on the device, but I recommend just doing that in Photoshop on your computer.  The interface is simple, but limited.  If you're scanning your old film negatives or vacation slides, you'll probably get plenty of dust and scratches, so you'll want to use Photoshop to help clean that up anyways.

The 20MP resolution is more than enough for the slides that I have.  My main issue is that the dynamic range of the converter seems to be a bit limited so any photographs with high contrast lighting will come out looking either too dark or blown out.  A possible solution is to scan an image multiple times, changing the device's exposure setting each time, so you can eventually combine the images on your computer using HDR software.

Overall, it's a pretty versatile scanner, and it's pretty good for home use if you regularly shoot on film.  If you're planning on buying this for a one-time conversion of your old family photo negatives and slides, I'd recommend just going to a professional service.  The cost of the device plus the amount of time that it will take you isn't really worth it.","Good, entry-level film scanner",1415836800,14,

First thing I noticed is how poorly put together it is. (I'll post a picture - Amazon sometimes delays pics). The pins and magnets (white buttons) are metal or magnets with white smooth round stickers on the top to make them look rounder and fit the style. But they were not glued on evenly. Several of them looked terrible and will definitely fall off with use. Even the white board itself looks like it is too large for the magenta foam backing. The whole set looks like it doesn't fit together well. And the little magnetic buttons won't hold anything large - maybe sticky notes at most. But then you're covering up most of the white board.

Does it stick on a locker? Yes. Does it have push pins with holes (the magenta at the bottom half are actually holes in the white board where you can push the pins in)? Yes.

This is an anvil type cutter and not a bypass type cutter as it typical for smaller capacity cutter - this is just a comment and is not a problem.

1) I use light lines on my printed images to show where to cut.  The laser was so bright that I couldn't see my lines at all.  Also, it was a very wide beam - almost 1/16"" at the base where it projects from.  I ended up putting tape over it so I could see what I was doing.  I thought the laser would be awesome, but it just didn't work out for me.

2) The handle has a neat locking mechanism that automatically latches as soon as you push the blade all the way down.  It's clever and it works great, but it locks the blade every time you push the handle down.  It's totally not friendly if you're working quickly doing multiple cuts (I use this for my business and usually do hundreds of cuts at a time).

3.0,True,"01 27, 2017",ACSJ5X37LIDWY,B01DN9NX0I,,Kirinjin,"Positives:  It's cheap.  It does cut documents into ribbons, and can handle six to eight sheets at a time, although the motor labors above four sheets.  It does cut CDs into three or four pieces (if that's not small enough for you, you can probably put the shards back through for another pass).  It does cut up credit cards, sort of.  The right edge support pulls out and extends maybe a couple of inches, so you can set the shredder on a slightly larger hopper, which you will absolutely need to do.

Negatives: The shreds are full-length to the paper, and considerably wider than other shredders I've seen and used.  A great deal of information is still legible, and it would take very little effort for a dumpster diver to reconstruct and tape together your ""secure"" documents.  The shreds are very  bulky, and the small hopper fills up too quickly to be of use.  If the hopper fills up so the shreds touch the shredding unit, the motor just stops in the middle of a page, so you'll have to stop every dozen pages or so to empty the hopper or at least compress down the shreds somewhat.  The document opening is 8.5 inches wide: no more.  A full sized letter sheet will pass through without problems, but nothing even a tad wider.  And if you have any documents printed sideways, this means you'll essentially cut right along the lines of text, accomplishing nothing.  Try to cut a credit card across the numbers and magnetic strip (so no shard will have much information), and all you get is some lines scored across the card.  In order to actually cut the card, you have to run it through vertically, meaning the entire set of numbers will all be on one shard, accomplishing little or nothing.

All in all, this is not money well spent.  Get a ""cross cut"" shredder instead, which cuts the shreds into vertical confetti.  It's not only exponentially more secure, but less bulky as well.  Then use scissors on your old credit cards, and snap those CDs in half.  I'm told that microwaving CDs, although great fun to watch, is not a good idea.  But it sure does destroy the data.",Not worth the price.,1485475200,38,

This one had a bit of both, but ultimately that just meant for me it fell in the middle, nothing stellar, nothing absolutely horrible.

It's the only shredder I've had that has a ""force forward"" option.  All the ones I've personally had only had the ""Auto"" forward, and a hard ""reverse"" to get something unstuck.  This one actually has a hard ""forward"" option as well, which I thought could possibly be handy if you have to rock something stuck back and forth.  I also thought that would be nice for some of the smaller things I've shredded in the past, that stopped before they finished because they couldn't keep the sensor engaged long enough to finish.  It worked as I expected it to, but that really was the only thing that set this one apart for me.

My current one has wheels on it even though it's barely larger than this one, but I was amazed at how used to those wheels I had become.  I usually leave my shredder in my ""office"" at home (unused third bedroom) and I pull it out into the great room when it comes time to shred things.  I'll let mail and such pile up for a month or two before I sit down to shred, so I like the wheels for bringing it where I'll use it.  If you are a person who shreds things as you come across them, then this won't bother you at all.

I also liked the CONCEPT of the small plastic bin that sits inside to catch plastic, so it's separate from the paper.  But the plastic catcher didn't catch my credit card shreddings because cards goes down the slot in the front like paper does, instead of the CD tray in the back which is what the bin is positioned under.  And since the CD tray is just two rollers that break a CD, you can't use the back slot for credit cards, since it won't cut them up.  So the plastic bin just ended up being something that gets in the way when the shredder starts to get full of paper.

It really does overheat fast compared to some other units I have here. The 12 she capacity is based on a 75 gsm paper.  It shows 10 sheets for 80 GSM.  I have no idea what the ""weight"" of the normal junk mail stuff I get from credit card companies and such are, but this struggled even at just 6 sheets thick.  It recommends no more than 200 sheets of paper at one time, and I'd guess that means 200 single sheets fed successively, because doing four to six sheets at a time, I ended up waiting for it to cool down by the time I hit about 110 to 120 sheets, since it had already overheated.

If you're just a simple home user with the occasional junk mail or credit app or something you want to shred, this would do the trick, but if you're a home user like me who ends up with a bunch of stuff you run through at one time every month or two, I'd go with a different option.",A middle of the road shredder,1404950400,,

The pen does NOT come with ink, only a converter. Fine for me, but if you're buying a first pen, buy a bottle of noodlers ink (parker quink is okay but noodlers is as good as it gets and is made in the US)

NOT A CALLIGRAPHY PEN. Just a very broad medium nib with limited flex. It also had a lot of stop-start issues with parker quink and two bulletproof noodlers inks. Bear in mind, this is a steel nib and chinese build quality can occasionally be spotty. I had to open the shoulders of the nib and then bend the point to get it to flow, now it's almost too wet, but writes well (wet, no stop-start, mild-moderate feathering) with the typical lack of feedback a steel nib offers.

If you do enjoy the pen but want it to write better, it uses a #5 nib, easily replaceable with a Knox #5 nib (just grab the nib by the point with a paper towel and pull and it slides right out. Same for the feed. It can be tight the first time, but just pull, nothing will break) that will really open the pen up to write like it should. I honestly don't love medium nibs, so I'd suggest a fine for most people, extra fine for me, but knox makes exceptional steel nibs that have been writing well in my pens for a long time. If you're writing notes in class on notebooks, I suggest extra fine.

Overall, the pen itself does feel very well built, far better than I was honestly expecting. all the gold plated parts are proper metal, the feed and point holder (silver part) is also solid metal, the plastic is smooth and the fit and finish is great. The plastic itself apparently varies wildly in color, as mine came with very few white inclusions that for some reason just sit in the middle and are all grouped up, which makes it look like it's scratched, not black/white.

If you are already accustomed to fountain pens, I'd say go for a jinhao 250 and spend $8 on a knox nib if yours doesn't write well. If this will be your first pen, get the pilot I mentioned above. THAT pen is just ridiculously good writing out of the box and writes most similarly to a very fine rollerball, which I've found people unaccustomed to fountain pens really seem to like.",decent pen. Good build quality. Poor nib (replace with a #5),1485388800,8,

This is a great all-in-one printer at a great price. I especially appreciate all the thoughts that must've gone into to make this printer because it's not excessively large for what it offers: flatbed scanning, multiple feeders, lovely results. My last Canon had a paper tray which always stuck out because it couldn't be stowed away. Annoying.

The setup took a while - you might need to visit Epson's website to download some updates.

This is great for printing colored documents and photos on the go. It prints black-and-white documents too, but I would get a separate laser printer for that due to the higher cost of toners for inkjet printers. I also wouldn't print several gigs of photos stored in my computers and cellphones - I'd use a photo-printing company for such huge volumes.

It's a great value for a well-designed printer which produces colorful results.

****************
Edited to add a 3-star review in July 2018: The printer was working well, playing nice with both Mac and PC machines. Then, the horizontal banding showed up. After running the ""print clean head"" and nozzle cleaner, it looked like the yellow ink cartridge was bad and had a much darker color. Unfortunately, running those system checks use up a lot of toner, so I had to replace all 5 toner cartridges with new ones. I rant the various cleaning features few times, and the printer returned to a reasonably acceptable form, though there was a slight horizontal banding. I would've like to run the cleaning features, but the process used up over 1/2 of the toner inks!!! The new black one is almost gone! I wish I could've cleaned only the yellow one, but you can't select just one cartridge/color to be cleaned.

So, I just spent about $85 on toner cartridges to get this to work again, which is a complete waste. Plus, I still need to clean a little more because yellow remains slightly dirty. At least the printer prints the correct colors with not much banding for casual needs. I know inkjet printers use up toner ink quickly, but this was ridiculous. Otherwise, everything works, and I appreciate the many features the printer has. But, you'll spend a lot on toner cartridges. There's no way each ""regular"" cartridge has a capacity of 250-300 pages and the XL cartridge of 500-650 pages.

3.0,True,"04 2, 2015",A4ZQZP41D95JO,B003KUWOE2,,Former Pro Armchair Quarterback,"This was our second ExcelMark stamp purchased from DiscountRubberStamps, both were somewhat perplexing experiences:  We went with the ExcelMark brand, because we'd just purchased some ExcelMark red ink refill that was incompatible with our previous 2000Plus stamp (I don't think it was actually made to be refilled).  When that didn't pan out we purchased a new ""Fragile Handle with Care"" ExcelMark stamp to ensure compatibility with the ink refill we'd already bought.  The Fragile stamp came in perfect condition, but the box lid had been torn off prior to shipping, as it wasn't in amazon's shipping box either.  We inquired, were told by DRS to contact amazon since they handled the shipping, indicating that it had gone straight from the factory to amazon and they never even touched it.  Upon asking amazon what happened we were given a full refund and told to keep the stamp, even though we didn't request such or even imply dissatisfaction with the product, we just wanted to know why the box was torn open and if the instructions were missing, as there was nothing inside except the stamp, which appeared to be in perfect condition.  We thought there might be some greater elaboration on how to flip the dual-sided ink pad than the rough diagram built into the product itself.

Happy with the Fragile stamp we received (MUCH better stamp than the 2000Plus model it replaced) we felt a little like we owed it to DRS to replace our Do Not Bend stamp with them too, since we were given an unnecessary refund on the previous Fragile stamp.  The Do Not Bend stamp arrived quickly, shipped in a padded envelope.  The box didn't have the lid torn off and unlike our Fragile stamp this one had a rubber DRS sticker on the side of the stamp.  But this stamp came with a new oddity, the push instructions made into the plastic itself on the reversible inkpad tray was misprinted:  It had ""Push"" embossed on the side that you can't push from and the nature of the stamps design prevents it from being pushed the other way, as well as prevents the possibility that the tray could have been inserted backwards, as there are locking tabs on one side that prevent that from being possible.  It appears the mold for the tray itself must be defective, as strange as that seems.  Frankly, if it wasn't such a cheap product, I would have assumed it to be a knockoff, enforced further by the screenprinted ExcelMark label being side by side rather than over/under like the one pictured and the absense of rubber feet, though our Fragile ExcelMark also doesn't have rubber feet like the one pictured seems to.  Also worth noting is that one side of the ink pad also already needed re-inking, as it looked rather faded - which we indicated wasn't a problem, since we'd already bought the ink.

We again asked DRS what happened, figuring since they actually shipped the Do Not Bend stamp themselves they might be able to explain this curiousity.  Again, we got a fast reply from the company.  They agreed it was odd but offered no explanation, instead they offered to ship us another for free, telling us to keep both.  This was IMO above and beyond what was required, as we had already expressed satisfaction with the quality of the stamp we received despite the presumed manufacturing defect that in no way hinders operation or functionality of the product.

When the replacement arrived, we were surprised to find inside a Do Not Bend stamp made by Ideal instead.  Again we inquired, this time trying to be very clear that we were satisfied with the product so they wouldn't feel they needed to send us yet another one.  And again we received a fast reply, basically thanking us for notifying us of their mistake and answering a follow-up question we had regarding whether or not the Excel Mark ink refill would work with the Ideal stamp too - which they indcated it would.

You can draw your own conclusions from this interaction.  Personally, I'd have no qualms with ordering from DRS again, due to their customer service, despite the curious issues we've had with 3 our of 4 shipments from them.

As for this stamp itself, we love that you don't have to smash down hard to get it to ink uniformally unlike with our previous 2000Plus stamp bought from Staples.  Even when the ink is low, it leaves a uniform impression without much pressure, only the ink looks faded when it's low.  However, after receiving the Ideal stamp, we find that we like it even better.  The mechanism just works so much smoother on the Ideal stamp, where the ExcelMark stamps seem to rub or catch in multple places as you depress them.  The Ideal stamp actually has rubber feet too.  I'm not sure of the purpose yet, but it does make it feel nicer.

The most obvious advantage to the Excel is that the ink pad can be flipped so you don't have to re-ink the pad as frequently or have to wait an extra minute while the ink soaks into the pad.  I'm new to this type of re-inkable stamp, so I don't know if the inkpads themselves tend to wear out faster than the product.  But having multiple inkpads on the device for when one wears out is really the only significant benefit I see to having a reversible pad, as it doesn't take much longer to re-ink a pad than it does to flip it.  The hardest part is taking it in and out, which is relatively easy, though a bit clunky.

Both inkpads offer a nice clear lower for aligning the pad on the paper.  It's probably not an issue for most applications, but the ExcelMark  is even notched so you can even see the stamp rotate all the way down to the paper for potentially more precise placement if needed, since the casing is larger than the stamp itself.  The Ideal stamp on the other hand obscures the pad as you stamp.

If you decide to go with this or the Ideal, be sure to get some ink refill.  These type pads with their water-based ink really don't seem to be designed to last like a 2000Plus stamp.  You'll need to re-ink the pad periodically.  With the Excel, I've already felt compelled to re-ink it only after a few dozen stamps.  Other reviews criticizing the ink for being faded or not lasting should also probably be ignored, as it seems the nature of this type of stamp, unlike the 2000 Plus stamps that last 1000 to 2000 stamps (the ones I've had started fading and stamping uneven after only 500 or so unless you hit it rather hard and/or  rocked it back and forth, which just wears down the rubber even more) and then are apparently meant to be discarded.

Like the Ideal, the ExelMark uses a water-based ink, so it might smear on slick surfaces if it can't soak into the paper.  Stamping on plain bright white printing paper it seems to dry instantly, or at least won't smear if I rub it mere seconds later.  Don't expect it to stick to polymailers though, without gently covering it in clear tape.

My only disappointment - and my primary reason for not giving it a higher score - with the ExcelMark, as well as the Ideal DO NOT BEND stamps is that unlike our ""Fragile Handle with Care"" ExcelMark, the Do Not Bend writing doesn't attempt to maximize the size capacity either stamp is capable of.  Both stamps, sold by DRS, produced a DO NOT BEND impression that were identical in size and font style.  Indeed the stamp pads appear identical in every way.  It's pretty clear that these are universal bodystyles with a large plate made to receive a variety of stamp pads of varying sizes and styles.  Regardless, it was a bit disappointing that neither stamp pad was as large as the stamp body or pad plate were capable of holding, which seemed rather cheap, compared to our FRAGILE HANDLE WITH CARE ExcelMark stamp from DRS that clearly seems to be designed specifically for the size stamp plate it is being used on, where despite two lines of type, the word ""fragile"" uses a larger font than either Do Not Bend stamp does.

In the case of the ExcelMark, looking at the DO NOT BEND pad on the pad plate, it appears the lettering could have been 50% larger - with the Ideal stamp it appears it could have even doubled in size, as the Ideal stamp has a bit larger body, and a wider and taller pad plate than the ExcelMark, making the stamp pad itself look rather small affixed to the sticky pad plate mount inside.  I would have much preferred a more elongated font, like that pictured on the Ideal listing page, for a more noticable stamp.  It's not that big a deal, but it is an area for improvement that would make the product seem significantly more professional, like the Fragile stamp does.  The DO NOT BEND font on both stamps looks identical to the one pictured in this listing, pictured at the time of this review anyway.","Not as smooth as the Ideal 4912, but ExcelMark has other perks that may be worth considering.",1427932800,,

Update 23 April 2015: I've bought a few of these for both myself and others. A month or two after purchase, I was screwing the cap back onto the ink, and the cap broke (the cap is made of a very brittle variety of plastic, and the top of the cap literally broke off of the cylindrical threaded portion of the cap.) This is obviously disappointing, but I transferred the ink to another (hopefully air-tight) container, and have continued to use it since then. The ink itself is fine, but the packaging could be improved, and unfortunately I have to knock off a few stars as a result.

It would have cost more to buy a new printhead than buying a new printer. I don't understand the business model - it's supposed to be like razors and blades. The manufacturers are supposed to sell the hardware cheap, and make their money on the ink. Believe me, this thing uses up ink at an incredibly fast rate. Yet, they want to charge an arm and a leg for a printhead that only lasts 18 months?

I'm a very casual home user - could go for weeks without a single printout, and rarely print color photos. Basically this unit was setup on a counter and stayed - never moved. Very light usage. During the time I had the unit, it did have some quality issues. For example, there were several times it would not use paper from the cassette and instead would require me to feed paper thru the rear vertical tray (my printer settings were set to use the cassette).

Print speed was average. Quality was good. But due to quality and reliability issues, I can only give this 3 stars.

Note to Canon: I would have replaced the printhead if you sold it for a reasonable price (say $40-$50). Instead, I purchased a new printer from Brother for $85, and they will be getting my future ink business. You made it too challenging to keep me as a customer. And from what I hear (Consumer Reports), the Brother is very economical on ink usage. The Brother was very easy to setup and works fine.

If you are considering this phone primarily for Link2Cell, you don't need to read my review either, because I did not even test this feature, and I don't think I will ever use it. Link2Cell allows you to use this cordless phone system to make calls using your cell phone service. This is the feature for those who wish to completely rely on their cell phone service and get rid of the landline phone service. The feature is also useful in a situation where in your house you have just a few spots where cellular signal is good, and in that case you could place your cell phone at one of those strategic spots, and make phone calls using this cordless phone anywhere in your house, through your cell phone service. But I don't believe this is a common situation, and even if it is, it is becoming less important with the Wi-Fi calling features on the smart phones becoming more and more popular.

But I bought this phone system primarily for one reason: so that I could use a Bluetooth headset for the benefit of hands-free calling.  I often make very long phone calls, sometimes several hours. Holding a handset that long is simply not an option anymore.

For this feature alone, this phone works, but just barely. It does work. I was able to pair it with my Plantronics Voyager without setup troubles. And the sound quality is quite good.  But there are some serious design flaws.

Specific issues:

(1) Only the base unit can be paired with a Bluetooth headset, not any of the handsets (there is an imperfect workaround, see below). This is an important limitation actually. You really don't want use the base unit to dial numbers on this phone, because the base unit has no access to the phone book, making dialing too difficult. If you use the phone to make many calls, unable to use a phone book is outright crazy.

(2) When paired with the base unit, incoming calls do ring on the Bluetooth headset (which is good news), but making an outgoing call isn't a smooth act, and feels rather awkward and non-intuitive. You need to first press the speakerphone button on the base unit, and dial the number you want call. Only after the call gets through and connected, you will then need to press the call button on the Bluetooth headset to take over the voice from the base unit to the Bluetooth. Sounds complicated? Because it is. This is a result of not having seamless Bluetooth dialing, and it's probably one of the major reasons why new business phone systems tend to use a much more expensive solution.

Sure it is still very helpful if you're making long calls, but there's got to be a better way to do this.

(3) No, there is no direct Bluetooth pairing with any of the handsets. For some reason, before I bought this phone I came under the impression that it could do that. But no.

Primarily because I need to be able to use the phone book, which is not available on the base unit, the ability to use a handset with Bluetooth headset is critical to me. As a result I almost packed it for return.

However, I looked rather deeper into the instructions and discovered a feature that, although still quite awkward and imperfect, is usable.

The feature is called ""Call Sharing"", which allows you to join a call currently on a handset, using a Bluetooth headset. This feature allows you to first make a call using a handset, and, after the call was connected, join the call from the Bluetooth headset. This allows you to dial from a handset, but then use the Bluetooth headset to talk, as if it were paired with the handset (when it is really not). Dialing from a handset is far easier and less time-consuming than doing so from the base unit.

To use this feature, you need to first set up the ""Call Sharing"" feature on the handset. It's not too difficult to do if you carefully follow the instructions, and once you've done that, you can forget about it.

The ""Call Sharing"" works but it is not perfect.

First, the entire dialing process is awkward, and even complicated. Probably so complicated that you might forget how to do it if you don't do it very frequently.

Assuming you have successfully set up the ""Call Sharing"", to make a call, you pick up your handset and make the call as usual. After the call is connected, you then press the call button on your Bluetooth, and then immediately MUTE the handset.

Yes, you do need to MUTE handset, otherwise both you and the other side of the caller will hear interference, this is because you are too close to the handset, and essentially you are speaking to both the handset and the Bluetooth at the same time.

So you see how awkward this is. The ""Call Sharing"" is really meant for a scenario where two callers on your side are in two different rooms and couldn't hear from one another.

But the thing does work this way, so I decide to keep the phone.

Overall, if you are still lingering with a conventional phone system, this is a great product. But if you have already got used to advanced smart phone dialing system, or software-based computerized calling system, this phone is downright outdated, like any other cordless phone. It may be one of the best landline phones in the market today, but still so outdated.

Unfortunately, unless you go for more expensive business phone systems, this is what we get for families and small businesses in today's market. There's a huge disconnection between the traditional landline phone systems and the new technologies, and the two are not merging. So unfortunately, for a landline phone, this is as good as you can get.","Great as a conventional phone, but falls short in its Bluetooth capabilities",1413590400,22,

However, there are some serious drawbacks to this printer, which should not have existed, as this device was sold as a wireless printer for the Mac and as a speedy machine.

The first and most obvious drawback is how  slow this thing is.  When I turn it on in the morning, I actually have time to make a cup of coffee from scratch before it boots up!!  Come on, are you kidding me!?!

In fact, everything this printer does, it does slowly, except perhaps printing out pages in draft mode.  In this day and age, nothing should be this slow.  I cannot even remember how many times I needed to just make a copy of something, but the machine was off, and people just didn't want to have to wait (who had seen this happen before).  Very embarrassing.

The second major problem is I never could get this machine to print wirelessly, which was the exact reason I bought this model in the first place.  What a disappointment.

I spent hours on the phone with HP, who blamed my Mac and then my wireless company.  Then I would spend hours on the phone with my wireless company, until they couldn't fix it and of course blamed HP.  In the end, they both blamed Apple!  :-#

Just to test the theory, I had a friend bring by their windows laptop, and that never printed wirelessly either.  He never got his printer working wirelessly either.
  I eventually gave up because my blood pressure was getting way too high! ;-)

Another thing is the  ink runs out fast, and the computer complains if you use any secondary market refilled cartridges.

The one good part about the computer, is it is very nice looking, so I intend to use it as a paperweight somewhere in the house!

The printer works really well on this device. The images are much sharper than the HP printer I had been using before. I also have found that the scanner seems to scan images at a faster rate than my old HP printer. Between the two printer trays, the machine will actually hold a full ream (500 sheet) of paper, so thats really nice. Finally, I have noticed that the ink in this machine seems to last longer than the ink in my old HP printer. In my old printer, I would get about 100  120 sheets of paper printed before having to replace the cartridges. So far, Ive printed over 150 sheets of paper on this machine and theres still ink.

With that said, however, there are some disadvantages about using the CANON MAXIFY MB2320 ALL-IN-ONE COLOR PRINTER as a printer. The biggest fault I have with the printer is the size. I originally opted to test and examine this printer because it was advertised as being a home printer that can be used for business functions. That might be the case, but the CANON MAXIFY MB2320 ALL-IN-ONE COLOR PRINTER is about twice the size of my old HP printer. I had to do a little bit of rearranging to fit this printer on the printer stand. Ive gotten used to it now, but its still quite bulky.

In addition, it took me longer to set this printer up with my computer than it did to set up my old HP printer. With my old HP printer, I just stuck a disc in the computer and hooked a USB cord into the back of the desktop hard drive and in about ten minutes everything was ready to go, including wireless printing. It took me over ninety minutes to figure out how to properly set this printer up with my computer due to some issues with the wi-fi and the printer. Granted, Im not an IT person, but it shouldnt take a lay person more than 30 minutes to set up a home printer that will be used for business purposes.

Lastly, the printer takes longer to print the first document than should be necessary. When I first got the CANON MAXIFY MB2320 ALL-IN-ONE COLOR PRINTER hooked up, I tried printing a couple of sample documents. I thought something was wrong because it took almost a full minute for the printer to begin printing the first document I sent. It printed the second document more quickly. However, the next day when I used the printer again the same thing happened. This is more of annoyance than anything else, but it is an annoyance that isn't necessary.

I have not used the fax part of this printer and will not be doing so because I do not need a fax at home.

Overall, the CANON MAXIFY MB2320 ALL-IN-ONE COLOR PRINTER is a decent printer. Its rather bulky, can be a little difficult to initially set-up, and has some annoying printer delays. However, it holds a lot of paper, prints extremely crisp documents both in black and white and in color, and has a long printer cartridge life. With that said, its not a printer needed for just ordinary day-to-day means, but if you print off a lot of documents, its worth looking into purchasing.","Prints Great Documents, But Is Bulky and Has a Few Major Annoyances",1417651200,5,

Beware of who you buy these from since most sellers are now selling a cheaper quality. I originally bought these from Valuemailers and received the thinner ones with a thin black film lining (not lt grey like in the description or picture). I contacted them thru email and their customer service was TERRIIBLE! The guy I dealt with was rude and argumentative! They didn't send me what was in the description or the picture and they didn't have the ones I ordered either. They said these were the only ones they carry. I was very dissapointed to say the least!

I then bought these bags from AMAMAX and I have to say they are the only company that I found that ships what they show in the picture and description. They only carry the ones with the lt grey lining(I checked directly with them to make sure before buying other sizes). Since they are a direct importer of these bags they only sell this type. Not only did I receive a high quality mailer, their customer service was also very helpful (and friendly).

Now I only buy my polybags from AMAMAX. They still belive in delivering what they claim to. I will never buy these from any other seller (especially NOT Valuemailers).

Christensen,"Setup on this printer is relatively straightforward - I had no issues getting it onto my local network using both the wired and wireless connections.  It shows up automatically as an AirPrint printer for all the iOS devices on the network, and the MacBooks in the house found the printer immediately through the ""add printer"" section of System Preferences.

From a performance standpoint, this unit really does a great job - images are sharp and clear, even on inexpensive regular computer paper, and the print speed is remarkably fast.  The Mac drivers seem to work very well, and double-sided printing is easily accessible from most apps.

The paper handling also appears remarkably good.  The unit suffers far fewer paper jams than previous HP and Brother ""full duplex"" printers I have had in the past.

Like most printers nowadays, the construction is all plastic, and if you leave the paper trays extended out and someone bumps them, they come off.  The good news is that they are relatively easy to snap back in place (rather than breaking off completely).

One of my only two complaints about the printer is that the ink cartridges are very expensive and there are no good aftermarket suppliers (yet).  The only aftermarket ink available on Amazon seems to have problems with clogging.  As a result of this, I have stuck with the Epson ink, which is quite expensive, especially if you do a lot of color printing.

The other complaint is the user interface for the setup and use of the ""cloud"" services.  For some reason, Epson has chosen to make the simple task of emailing a scanned document to someone overly complicated.  There is no way (that I have been able to determine) to choose an email address at the time of scanning.  It must be pre-programmed into the unit (using a separate PC or Mac) once you've set up an Epson cloud services account (free).  This means that if you ever want to email a scanned file to someone you must first go to your computer, remember how to use the setup software, log into the Epson cloud account, update the address book available in the printer/scanner, push the update to the printer over the network, and then go scan your job.  Instead, I just email it to myself and then forward using my email on my computer.

Over the years, I have used several inkjets from Epson and an HP LaserJet 1020.  The ink jets always seem to run out of ink too fast, costing more than the printer to replace the ink.  The HP LasertJet has been going strong since 2006 and is only on its second toner cartridge.

So, how did I get here?  Even though my HP LaserJet is still in use (the inkjets have been retired), I wanted a wireless version of my Laserjet.  This is it.

This is a beautiful printer.  The outside is mostly glossy black plastic, with some matte black.  It feels well-built and is heavy, due to some metal internals,which are noticeable on the backside.

The unboxing experience with this printer is simple enough, although three sets of instructions are provided, all mentioning various stages of the same installation steps.  Setup involves removing the protective plastic film all around the glossy parts, removing the Styrofoam inside where the toner cartridge lives, and removing an orange tab and pull strip from the toner cartridge.  The box includes everything you need, including the USB cable required for the initial configuration.

If you follow the directions provided in the Getting Started Guide, you will be up and running is 10 minutes or so.  While the documented setup instructions are clear and easy to follow, the software installation is only written from the perspective that the only computer to use this wireless printer is the one you are performing the setup on.  No additional client installation instructions are provided.  Because this is a wireless printer, it is not out of the ordinary to assume that perhaps more than one computer (or even a smartphone) would want to print to it.  So, once you have this printer setup and configured on the first computer, setting up additional computers involves the following steps.

Windows:
1) Download the full installation software from HP's site or use the provided CD.
2) Turn on the printer
3) Run the installer
4) Select Install Printer Software from the tab at the top
5) Select wireless install
6) Select Easy install
7) Select HP LaserJet Profession P1100W Series
8) Select Connect to a Configured Wireless Network Printer
9) Select ""Select from a list of detected printers""
10) Click Next to open a firewall port for the printer
11) Select the printer when it is found
12) Enable Direct Print
13) Print Test Page
14) Click Finish
15) Run the HP ePrint installer when prompted
16) Reboot when prompted

MAC:
1) Turn on the Printer
2) Go to System Preferences
3) Select Printers and Scanners
4) Click ""+"" to add
5) If Bonjour doesn't discover it, select IP. If it found it with Bonjour, click Add.
6) Type in your printer's IP Address
7) Click Add
8) Wait for setup to complete

Overall, the is a rock solid printer with one exception.  The power button seems cheaply made and feels like it could break easily.  Beyond that, I cannot think of any cons about build quality.  There seems to be some delay between pressing print on the computer and the time the printer actually starts printing.  It could just be my network though.

Based on my history with my HP LaserJet 1020 and what I have done so far with this printer, I can easily recommend it to anyone.  It is the one and only printer you need (assuming you don't need to print in color of course).",My New Workhorse,1407024000,2,

I got it when it was on sale. You can setup your own journal really easily if you use the interwebs but I like the format of this particular journal.

The daily, weekly, and monthly views allow adequate space to write down whatever you need to write down in the respective area. The downside is your are locked in to the categories that the developers want you to use but you can color outside of the lines and do your own thing if you want. For someone who is new to this planner thing, I appreciate the prompts. For the money, I think there's adequate entries. I'm not sure how long this is meant to least--6 months, 1 year? I dunno. But it seems like a reasonable price for what you get, especially if it's on sale.

I tried to erase a few words from a sentence I had written a month prior to when I attempted to erase it...the ink acted like regular pens. A friend who has one of these pens comfirmed after a while it cant erased. He showed me a test that he wrote with this pen (of which our teacher made a note saying not to use pen on tests) he tried to erase some of it...it didn't work.

I think I will experiment on this to see how long you can change it before it becomes permenent.

The pen writes well but could be improved. But suprisingly the pen erases much better than expected. I had some pens that erased back in the 3rd grade however they erased with an eraser (if I remember correctly) These however erase with friction, you can use an eraser too but it doeesnt erase as easily.

It would be a cool idea to make an eraser for these pens thats like a jumbo version of the little ""nub"" on the pen. I'm not sure if that has been thought of or produced yet. However I hope that little ""nub"" isn't what makes these pens so exspensive. If so you can throw that idea out, only people making 6 figures can afford to drop a thousand dollars on a 2x1x1 high fricton creating eraser.

They are pretty exspensive, as with other products on the more exspensive side (as others have noted) they will attract theifs and other people that say ""I promiss I'll give it back to you next period,"". but seem to keep ""forgeting"" them in their locker. So unless you have money to blow on filling your whole 3rd period gemometry class's pencil bags, I suggess you keep your pens to youself.

I have been a user of Pilot Dr. Grip Gel pens for many years.  Since I do a lot of writing with a pen, I often experience some hand strain.  I found that when using these pens my writing was better and my hand more relaxed.  When I saw this new Dr. Grip pen, I just had to try it.

First I found that the ""center of gravity"" feature is useful.  This new pen balances slightly more toward the writing tip.  The result is that my hand is a bit more relaxed and I feel less strain after a writing session.

The ink is a different matter.  I like the ink  that I get for the Pilot Dr. Grip  gel pens (earlier model ""Grip"" pens) as it writes better and is effective on most surfaces, where the new ink is limited on some surfaces.  The gel  cartridges will not fit this new pen, so currently I am using the one that comes with the pen.  I believe the problems with this ink can be solved by putting the old ""gel"" ink in the cartridge for the new pen (or at least making it an option that can be purchased)

This is the first rest I've had since moving my office to my home, and it's very comfy. But it, too, alas, has a few problems.

Firstly, it is too long, stretching as it does perhaps three inches beyond the edge of the keyboard on either side. On the other hand, I see another reviewer suggests using the end as a wrist rest while using the mouse. An excellent idea, I will try, if possible, by slightly rearranging things.

Secondly, the wrist rest is a tad too thick for the thin Dell keyboard that I (like another reviewer) also use --- my one last vestige of an otherwise highly unsatisfactory set of run-ins with Dell computers.

The inside is tan and stitched.  Besides the 1-inch ring there are three pockets. One each is on the front and back of the binder. In addition there is a 'window' pocket suitable for a business card. There is no plastic over this window. It is open.  The binder also has a loop where you could hang a pen.

They are solid, dependable, reasonably fast, fairly inexpensive to operate and we have not have any problems with any of the units.  They are used heavily in an office environment.

The best (in my opinion) small laser black and white printer is the HP P2050 which by itself sells for about $275.  That printer has a startup time for the first printed page after being idle for 1 hour, of only about 3 seconds.  From a cold start, the Brother multifunction takes about 25 seconds.  Subsequent pages print very quickly on the Brother, but not quite as quickly as on the HP.  The noise during printing is similar for both with the Brother perhaps a bit quieter.  During idle, in an office setting, you don't notice the fan noise at all.  In a bedroom, the noise is low but definitely noticeable.  The fan shuts off after 30 seconds on the HP and after about 10 minutes on the Brother, so if it is in the bedroom and you want to go to sleep, don't print that page.  Still, compared to most other printers it is very quiet and reasonably fast.

The scanner part of the Brother multifunction is excellent.  It is about half as fast as the Fujitsu scanner but that is the best stand alone scanner you can but and costs almost twice as much as this multifunction.  We have never had a jam in the sheet feeder and the flat bed part gives you additional flexibility the Fujitsu does not.  Scanned images are very crisp even in low resolution settings and the scanner can factor out color paper backgrounds very effectively.  The copy function works with the flatbed or sheet feeder and is quick as well.

The fax works well and we have not had any problems, but have not used this feature very much.  Overall, the Brother laser multifunction is not quite as good as best in class stand alone units but is priced lower than these and gives you all the features in one unit. It is easy to use and to live with.  We never had to open the manual.",Great multifunction for the money,1289088000,,

However, I'm not a fan of how thick the elastic bands are at all. They are too thick and the refills end up bending pretty drastically to fit around them. The huge knots are also really annoying to deal with. They would be really easy to replace though with smaller elastics and the Midori TN rubber bands to add extra refills.

I'm also not a huge fan of the finish on the leather. There is nothing wrong with it but I was just hoping for something less shiny and more easily weathered. I ended up replacing both the notebooks with the original (and sadly much more expensive) Midori Traveler's Notebooks because I liked the finish of the leather better and I'm much happier.

That being said I think these notebooks are totally worth the price when you get all the refills as well as the zipper pocket which I actually prefer to the Midori brand one.

It's rather difficult to adjust. Each of the joints is locked down by a hex bolt, which is good for sturdiness and long life, but clumsy to use and requires you to have a hex key around at all times. When they're locked down tight, there is still just enough ""give"" in the joints for last-minute adjustments, which is handy. But go to far and the bolts start to loosen and you're reaching for the hex key again. Additionally, there are two sizes of hex key needed, depending on what you're adjusting. Both are supplied.

The height is also hard to manage - there's only one vertical joint, which uses a momentary locking mechanism that you push while adjusting. Supporting the monitor's weight with the other hand makes it easy to get the joint to unlock, but makes the effort clumsy. Thankfully, though, the vertical joint provides plenty of height for use while seated.

While the overall build quality is superb, the seemingly-inconsequential cable management clips are poorly designed. Two plastic clips thread through the arm from opposite sides and are supposed to ""click"" together. Mine never click. The slightest movement causes them to pop apart. A minor thing, but nonetheless annoying.

It's possible to remove the middle arm for shallower desks. This is a nice feature and I might take advantage of it in the near future.

There are lots of high-quality parts included, including thumbscrews, an adapter plate and several mounting options. The included instructions are a little puzzling, but they do the trick.

So why the 4-star review? Because this is an awesome product for under $70. There isn't a better monitor arm at this price, and few with this level of finish quality. If you're in the market and price sensitive, it's worth putting up with its quirks.

I've been through 3 different models and one was over $100. They all took awhile and broke the lead as you sharpened. Or, they only sharpened nicely with the expensive pencils. I teach 1st grade at a poor school. Parents buy dollar store china pencils. This one handles them very well. It never gets jammed either. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the one I got has an issue with the receptacle. If you close it all the way, the motor won't go when you insert a pencil. I have to crack it open ever so slightly to get it to turn on. Then while I am using it, the vibrations slowly cause the door to open more and after a bit, it's now too far open and again the motor shuts off. Annoying, yes. Worth it to sharpen 20 pencils in about 2 minutes with NONE of them ground down to nubs or coming out with broken lead or having my kids come back up complaining that the lead broke as soon as they started to write-DEFINITELY!

The cells offer a practical storage solution for bras, socks, and panties. They fit nicely in my closet shelving and also work well for transporting washed delicates from the laundry room. Another benefit is that they help me sort out and locate socks quicker... So much better than piling them in a drawer!

Out of the three, I find the 24-cell box to be the most useful. It fits a pair of socks nicely and can even accommodate 2 pairs of smaller ankle socks. The medium-sized (6-cell) box, intended for bras, is too small for mine. I still manage to stuff 6 of my Victoria Secret bras in there, but it's a tight fit. It works better for smaller bras... A's and B's, but if you need them for C's or larger, don't plan on this being your ""ultimate solution"" to bra storage.

Appearance wise: The lattice print is subtle and cute. I also like the grey color. The fabric is flimsy, and I certainly would NOT call this a high-quality product. However, it doesn't look tacky for what it is and actually provides a functional decorative purpose. Perspective: I would not be embarrassed to have these out on a shelf in my walk-in closet during an Open-House. (Other than not wanting strangers to see my delicates, LOL.)  Plus, considering how they only cost me around $6, complaining about the quality is not justified. (Let's be realistic... Really, what can you expect for that price?) However, I wouldn't even entertain the thought of paying more,

I would gladly spend a little more for a better quality product. The dividers are TOO flexible, and I would prefer the fabric exterior to be a little thicker.

I was using a small twist-type sharpener as a potable option but that always requires being near a trash can to catch the shavings or carrying a plastic bag around.  This one has a chamber fitted to it to catch the shavings and can be used plugged in or with batteries (4 AAs, not included).

It comes with a USB charging cable, a replacement sharpener core and instructions. Even with the batteries in this, its not really that heavy so you can easily carry it around. If I use it at work, I plug it into the USB port on my desktop. There are rubber discs on the bottom so that it doesnt slide around when you are sharpening something.

Functionally speaking, it does a good job of making sharp points without eating half of the pencil away. It will halt sharpening when done.

The only thing that I had issues with was emptying the chamber of shavings because they will just come right out all over the place  do it over the rubbish bin. I learned the hard way  pencil shavings are a mess!

Other than that, this is working for me. If you are out and you run out of battery, you can also use this as a simple twist sharpener.

Boudreau,"Like all the other Avery labels, these are the thick, easily adhering, white labels on glossy backing. They fit perfectly with any standard printer as letter size paper. Like their other labels they stay stuck onto paper, cardboard, and plastic pretty well. If you know Avery labels, this is just a different shape.

I find that Avery labels work best with Microsoft Word if Word knows about the specific Avery template, in this case 8218. My copy of Word 2010, did not have a template for 8218. When I was looking for a way to download this template from Avery's site, I saw the ""design and print online"" option. I was skeptical, because my past experience with Avery software was not good, but this was a nice surprise. You can find the right form by searching for product #80500, or just go here: http://dpo.print.avery.com/dpo7-us/app/US_en/dpo.jsp?sku=80500. It is easy an easy to use way to get some cool designs for your labels. I don't know how well this would work with a mail merge from your contacts or a list in office, because I didn't need that.

I had been putting names on paper and then arranging them on the floor. I figured this white board would be much more practical. When it came in the mail my son said he needed something to track what he needed to do but wanted something  besides using electronics, so I gave the board to him.

Let me just say if you are looking for something refined and finished for a professional setting, I wouldn't suggest this at all. As others have stated, and if you look closely to the pictures on the product page, the edges are not finished; there is no trim. However, if you need something for personal use around the house, this works just fine.

What I like is that the holes are predrilled and it comes with the hardware needed to install. What is also pretty cool is that there are caps included to cover-up the screws.

What I don't like is that it does leave ghost marks. If you look at the picture right above the ""T"" to the right you can see where an ""S"" was written then erased. Also there is no eraser included. I'm sorry but for this price point one should've been included. It does come with a black skinny marker and a holder for that marker. Again this is a fail for me. Most dry erase usage is with a thick marker so one of those should've been included along with a holder for a thick marker.

This board will serve the needs we have, but again if you need a dry erase board for a professional setting this is not the choice for you.

Am I using it wrong or something? Anyone with any tips, please respond.

**Update**
Figured out the trick to this sharpener. At first I thought that the different sizes reflected different sized pencils, but that's not the case. You actually have to use the bigger hole to shave off the wood, and then after, use the smaller hole to sharpen the lead.

It's also the perfect size to put in my purse and it helps keep me organized. The included inserts were a nice touch. For those curious, you get:

- A three year calendar on one page and pages that list holidays and special days all around the world.
- An entire calendar year in the form of a week on two pages. Mine started in July 2015 and ended on January 2017.
- A ruler/page divider.
- A top loading plastic sleeve.
- A lined notepad that hooks into the back pocket.
- 6 page dividers.
- A small assortment of colored, lined, graph and blank papers. Around 20-30 sheets total in the assortment.

I actually ended up removing the inserts that came with the planner because I preferred to use my own. But it's very thoughtful of them to include these so someone can just get this planner and start using it right away.

My biggest complaint about this planner might seem like a pretty minor issue to some, but it is a major pain in the butt for me. The pen loop is a great idea. I love that I can hook in a pen and keep it with my planner. Super convenient. Unfortunately, the included loop is way, way, way too small. Yes, you can stretch it out, but it's ridiculous the amount of effort this takes for certain pens. A great deal of the planner community uses multipens and those are really thick. No way will you be able to fit a five-color multipen into this pen loop right out of the box. I use fountain pens primarily, and many of mine are thicker than the average ballpoint or gel pen too. I've been training my planner's loop for the better part of a month, and this loop still isn't big enough to accommodate the pen that I actually want to use. They can cut out this nonsense by just providing a larger pen loop right out of the factory.","Fantastic planner, only flaw is the pen loop.",1444262400,7,

Posting this review as I asked the question before purchase as to whether the device was functional with Libre Office. Nobody answered from Amazon users, so I ordered it anyway.

Before ordering, I tried to get Kensington support to answer whether the device worked with Win 8.1 (it does) and whether it worked with LibreOffice (this question they ignored).

So, I replied to the first answer and had my replied rejected as ""not conforming to their moderated standards"". Huh? What I asked in the reply was ""Does it work with LibreOffice?"". So, what part of the question they didn't like beats me. So, I docked one star for their stupid support forum rules. I just received a second rejection from Kingston support when asking why the first question was ""refused"". It takes long enough for them to moderate the question, so sounds manually done. Really weird.

I am teaching a class for the next 6 weeks...I'll try to post again sometime later with a further review addition.

I will just add that I really like it. It is a noticeable improvement over a fabric pad I had been using and didn't realize was a little limited. Time will tell if it helps with battery life, but even if it gives me 20% more battery life, that's good considering I use rechargeables. Tracking is excellent, and mouse movement of the slick and oh-so slightly textured surface is very smooth. In fact, I've had to adjust a little because my mouse glides more easily now. Accuracy is spot-on. The background design is okay, though I might opt for something more dramatic given the option and if it meant the same performance. Overall, I'm happy with this mousepad. The rubberized backing helps keep it firmly planted with no shifting during use. It did have a rather strong chemical odor (thanks 3M) right out of the box, but that has dissipated after a day of use and you have to sniff the pad directly now to detect anything.

Even during my brief initial use period, it has been an improvement over the basic pad I was using before. For the price, I'd recommend it.

I'm fairly experienced with many types of fountain pens ranging from 2 dollar ones to 300 dollar ones.  I;m quite surprised how well this pen is made. One thing i absolutely love about this pen is how easily the pen can be  dissembled for easy cleaning and nib swapping without having to buy a brand new pen. The grip section of the pen is triangular to assist all writers to have correct hand position and angle that ensures constant pen flow and minimal nib damage, which is why i would suggest this pen to anyone starting out! I bought three Lamy Safari for each work bag and use them all.  The fine nib is a little scratchy but not so bad that it bothers me, I would just assume its because its a finer nib. The nib is also very stiff that doesn't really have any cushion to it, and I'm not talking about those flexible/soft nibs that puts out line variation because this pen would not be able to flex! so don't put pressure on it! overall this pen is awesome and a must have for any occasion!

4.0,True,"08 21, 2009",A3IL4WNBMGBJRY,B001M0MZ6Y,,Brian Smith,"We had a two foot high plastic Pepsi bottle bank in the house for about 8 or 9 years, as close as we can recall.  No one remembers exactly how long.  We've been throwing spare change thinking someday we'll get around to wrapping it.  When the sides started to split and the tape we had used gave way, we decided it was time to roll it up and take it to the bank. But, the task seemed daunting.  So, I decided to look for an automated coin sorter.

I did a lot of research and it seems the ones that are less expensive just don't work all that well.  I think you usually get what you pay for.  So, I decide to splurge and go with this one which had gotten great reviews.  After seeing how these work, I'm glad I did.  The machine comes on and you hear a ""tick, tick, tick"".  You drop the coins and they start shooting out of the slots into the proper tubes.  I bought preformed coin wrappers so that it's actually wrapping and counting my coins at the same time.

In the coin jar, we inevitably had hair bands, plastic coins, dollar coins and other stuff you are not supposed to put into the machine.  Nothing really jammed it. The dollar coins just kept spinning and spinning around.  The machine continued to work. And, it was easy to open it up and remove the dollar coins (the the hair band that got in there).  We only overfed it once or twice enough to where it jammed and we had to open it up and move things around.  I think the fact that it plugs into the wall gives it enough ""oomph"" to work through things that would jam a less powerful machine.  A couple of times you could actually see the chassis bulging as the machine worked through jams.  Also, it's smart enough to reverse itself when it jams (unlike our garbage disposer).

The coin counting is accurate (I hope- I didn't check it).  The machine tells you exactly how many quarters, nickels, pennies and dimes should be in your tube.  And, it really makes it fun because it gives you a running total of all the coins.  Once it reaches the amount each tube should have, it shuts off and displays which is full so you can replace it.  If you figure it out, you can keep it running continuously by switching to a second tube for each type of coin while the machine is running.

The only thing you need to be cautious about is the machine doesn't weigh the coin to know when each tube is filled. It counts them as they should be going in. So, if a coin happens to miss the tube, it does not know (happened rarely).  Also, if you switch tubes before one is full, it's going to throw the count off and there's no way to get it back without resetting the total of all of the tubes and the running total.  We put $970 through the machine in less than two days and are very happy with its performance.  My 9 year old was running around the house looking for more money to put through it.

The machine seems to be very close to commercial grade, IMO.  It definitely can handle your coin sorting needs at home.  My only complaint is the manual doesn't explain what the three buttons on the machine do, exactly.  It was fairly easy to figure out.  But, for example, if you want to clear the machine, you have to hit AND HOLD the clear button.  It talks about the power switch. But, it doesn't tell you the power switch is on the back.  It doesn't tell you what to do if, for some reason, your count gets off on one of the tubes.

The machine was fairly expensive. But, it ran hassle free and for the amount of change we had, it was worth the investment.  Can't wait to gather up some more coins and put it through its paces again.",Fantastic,1250812800,106,

The 1170 is designed to store documents, and it does this well.  It is spacious enough to hold all of your most vital documents.  There are a pair of ridges on the inside that comfortably hold the end-hooks of normal hanging file-folders.  The unit is pretty heavy (about 30 lbs.).  The walls are extremely thick, and so is the lid.  The locking mechanism work well; I've never noticed snags or any other mechanical issues with the lock, and I've never needed to use any lubricant in the lock.

Very fortunately, I cannot attest to durability during a fire.  I can only assume that the solid body is a good reflection of its 1/2 hour fire rating.

If you are looking at buying this safe you need to take inventory of what you want.  As a ""fire safe"" this will presumably give your documents some level of protection against fire.  First, I do not believe that this safe is water-tight, or is even water rated.  I looked on the website and there is no mention of water that I could see.  This is important if there is a chance that the storage area may flood, or in the event that it is soaked by firefighters.  If your documents could get ruined in such an event, you may want to consider a safe that is water rated as well.

Most importantly, as a ""fire safe"" this safe is not designed to protect against people.  Yes, there is a lock on the front, but think of this more as a latch that will keep the lid secure and not a mechanism that would keep an adult out.  My wife and I each kept a key for the safe, and during a recent move we both misplaced our only copies.  Rather than pay for a locksmith, I decided just to break in.  With everyday tools from my garage I was able to break into it in less than a minute with minimal effort.  Even if a potential thief couldn't locate proper tools in your house/apartment, even a small person could hoist it under their arm and walk off with it.  Mind you, I consider the ease of break-in something of a feature.  Since the 1170 is only designed for fire, I don't want to have to pay someone if I've lost a key.  (Yes, by breaking in I effectively destroyed the safe as well.)

Most people hear ""safe"" and they assume that this implies ""from people"".  If you want your goods to be safe from intruders you will need (at minimum) a safe that is either too heavy for one or more people to carry off, or one that is designed to be bolted down and secured to the floor.  Even if the lock is more robust if the safe can be carried off the their will have all the time they need to find a way in.  A better lock is a useful feature only if they can't physically remove the safe.

As an inexpensive document firesafe, this may do the trick.  It is important that you don't purchase this safe with unrealistic expectations.",Good for its intended purpose--know what you are buying first.,1347667200,298,

It seems the company might be listening to customers, because at least one complaint I read about isn't an issue: the fan. Someone here said the fan was open (and someone else commented that your finger or leg will immediately stop it on contact, implying the fan is open); mine has a plastic housing around it.

Also, someone mentioned that the little ledge meant to stop the computer from sliding off when you raise the tabletop falls out. It's held in with two little dowel pegs, and the benefit of that is you can remove it when you want to, if you're not raising the top. It doesn't appear to be flimsy to me. The dowel pegs are about 1/2"" long and fit very snugly into the holes. The ledge might not even be necessary, though. I use a MacBook, and its little rubber grips seem enough to keep my laptop in place on the bamboo surface.

I'm impressed with how quiet the fan is, and how well it works - I've been using it for several hours now, and my laptop's fan hasn't come on (like it used to with the lap desk I bought this to replace).

Since this just arrived today, I'm still getting used to it.

The drawer isn't like the photo here, though - at least mine isn't. It's the same orange plastic that houses the fan, but with a strip of bamboo for its face. As someone else said, it's not large enough to hold much, but will be handy for jump drives and memory cards and my USB port when I'm not using it.

One down-side that might be true of every table like this is that in order to fold the legs again, you have to lower them completely, so you can't leave them adjusted to your preferred height. Not a huge problem, just a minor inconvenience.

The adjustable side of the table's top is held up by one metal stand which slips into wooden notches - hard to describe without an image. Sadly, the lowest setting it seems to have - based on the notches - doesn't actually work; the metal stand won't fit into that notch.

However, I needed a printer/scanner/copier in a hurry, and this one seemed a good value.  Also, I've had HP printers before, and I prefer them over Canon and Epson for durability.

The dreaded installation was a breeze.  The printer is easy to set up (a bit time consuming, though), and looks fantastic.  The tiny screen is a drawback, and the buttons for the screen are too close together, causing a problem even for my small fingertips.  For this, I've taken away a star.  But it prints well and quickly in all modes, scans beautifully (great software) and copies very nicely.  I haven't had it long enough to judge the ink levels, but I don't need to print out very much so it's not a major concern for me.  The pictures look fabulous.  Vibrant colour, very accurate.

In the picture, the printer looks huge, but it's actually quite compact and light.  I recommend it if you need to move your printer around from time to time.

How I review:
When I review a product said product automatically starts with four stars as I rarely will purchase anything below four stars.  I then add and/subtract stars based on certain criteria as listed below.
1. If an item is exactly what I expected and nothing more it will receive a four star rating
2. If an item surpasses my expectations it will gain a star
3. If an item goes slightly below my expectations it will lose a star
4. If the instructions for the product (if needed) are poorly written (hard to understand due to language issues or grammar) or just too hard to follow it will lose a star no matter if the product meets or exceed my expectations
5. If a product is significantly below my expectations I will deduct two stars
6. It will be rare that I would give a product one star since I buy mostly items that have a 4+ rating but in rare instances there may be a good reason that even a four star product gets a one star rating from me.  It could be because of customer service issues from the company but whatever the case is I will clearly explain my reason for giving a product only one star",Mount works perfectly for my non-VESA Samsung monitor,1525996800,,

Upon removing the 63Cb from its packaging, I immediately appreciated the heft and weight of the shredding unit.  It also comes with a large 5 gallon pull-out bin which inserts easily into the main housing.  The pull-out bin has a clear window on the front panel that enables users to ascertain whether it needs to be emptied.  I lined the pull-out bin with a plastic shredder bag before use.

The 63Cb is a lower to mid-level deskside shredding unit and can shred up to 10 sheets of paper, and can also handle staples, credit cards, and small paper clips.  This should be suitable for most households and will save trips to private shredding centers.  I tested the 63Cb with ten sheets of paper and it shredded them without a hiccup.  I next tried stapled sheets and small paperclips, again, no issues.  I call it the stealth shredder because it's amazingly quiet during operation, unlike my screeching HT700X.

The 63Cb has a top ""control panel"" comprising a power button and certain signal indicators.  The 63Cb also has a ""Safe Sense"" safety mechanism that automatically detects if fingers are carelessly placed near the shredder opening.  It worked as advertised.  The Safe Sense indicator lit up when I brushed my hand across the top surface; after allowing my fingers to linger there for three seconds, the machine automatically shut off.

I decided to deduct one star from the review because some of the papers were not uniformly shredded leaving larger than desired, unsecure pieces.  I think this is caused by the feeding mechanism crumpling papers and causing a convergence near the corner of the shredder.

In conclusion, the 63Cb should be a very good mid-level shredder for most households.  Persons with large amounts of documents for disposal should probably look upwards along the Fellowes lineup at the more industrial models.",I call it a stealth shredder!,1353456000,6,

However, there is one very large problem with that system - where I live, I get ZERO cell coverage at my house. I am up in the hills, and coverage is terrific everywhere else, but for whatever reason, I'm *lucky* if I'm able to use my cell at home. Typically, this means standing in one spot and trying not to breathe while having as short a conversation as possible. I invested in an iPhone, and this has helped quite a bit, but still not to the extent that I would be able to speak/hear clearly for any extended amount of time.

Against the advice of a friend (he had never tried this phone), I purchased this to see if it would help. I just figured that if it didn't work for me, I could always return it. Well, the thing rocks. Here's why:

*It was incredibly easy to synch my iPhone with the vTech. It holds the synch quite well - it will occasionally drop after my cell has been out of range for an extended period of time, but it's a very simple matter to re-synch.

*I'm not sure how this works as I'm not a tech-type person, but I can make and receive phone calls extremely clearly now when I use the handset vs. my cell. There is very little difference in the sound quality between the regular land-line and my cell on the handset.

*It is easy to use - again, I'm not very techy. Complicated things tend to confuse me ;) This is, for the most part, common sense to use the everyday functions.

I do not have experience with needing to synch multiple handsets. We only have the one at this point, and if/when we get another, that will be the only other one. We just don't need more than 2 handsets in the house. So, that is not an issue for me. Nor do I use some of the more obscure functions - just no need.

The text rendering isn't the greatest (a little pixelated but not terribly so) and I don't personally like most of the fonts... but all the options, the 4-line text, all the little icons, the huge memory have all made this my favorite label maker! I love that you can do upper or lower case and there is a bold and italic option. There is also a ""narrowness"" setting. The backlighting is a nice  feature too.  You can print text vertically or horizontally and there are 3 ""flag"" options for wire labeling or binder spine labeling. I didn't find the learning curve to be that steep after reading the manual... if I haven't used a feature in awhile it takes a bit of fiddling to remember, but overall I have to say not so much. There's a little ""cheat sheet"" on the back that's very helpful to trigger your memory if you've read the manual. The battery life is pretty decent and doesn't seem to draw power when not in use.  So, basically everything everyone says about this. Oh, the keyboard is QWERTY which  is a plus, and apparently not the norm. The cartridges are many! Lots of options there. Not cheap, but I honestly find that the cartridges last pretty long. We use it often but at the same time, I guess not THAT often. Often enough to miss it!  I have a Dymo LetraTag and The printing is nicer (smoother) but it only prints in caps.

So I just really like this one so much that when I got a ""motor error"" in the middle of  labeling some AV wires, I spent all of 20 minutes researching my options and just ordered another one from amazon. Wasn't happy about it but we use it so much in this house, and it really is the best deal in my opinion, for the price range.

I'm also writing this review because it might help someone. I got the ""motor error"" and it kept shutting down and I googled for hours and found nothing useful. I even sent a message to Epson support, and despite an autoreply saying someone would be in touch within 24 hours, that didn't happen. When I got the new one I decided I had nothing to lose so I took the old one apart. Just removed the battery cover, batteries, and loosened the 4 screws holding the back on.  Lifted it up and disconnected the wire bundle on the left, and just flipped the back over (don't lose the screws! ;) )  I saw the gears for the motor and tried to move them. They weren't stuck but as they turned around, it revealed that a tiny sliver of cut label tape was stuck in them. It wasn't actually stopping them from moving, but it must be very sensitive. I removed that with tweezers, reconnected the wires and closed it up and put the batteries back on... and it worked fine. I hope this helps someone else out there, because when I googled I found nothing useful aside from someone who said theirs just started working again a few days later and then broke again.

I think probably what could have caused this was the kids playing with the ""cut"" button even when there was no printed label. It must have jiggled a little bit up and cut a sliver... or maybe there are ""scraps"" when it cuts sometimes, or maybe I just got lucky with the ""Take it apart and put it back together maybe it'll magically work"" thing.","helpful ""motor error!"" tip at end :)",1431216000,14,

It has the 'all in one' features and I tried all of them out and they all worked with no problems, in fact they worked very well.

I used the machine at home to print some documents and pics to see the speed and quality. Nice clean pages and clear pics were delivered from this unit. Also I used the scan function to add some pics to my computer from an old photo album that I found. The scanner also performed very well, no problems and nice scanned image.

I decided to take it to work with me. I am assisting in a doctors office. I hooked up the printer to one of the computers in the office that did not have a printer connected to it and plugged the unit into the telephone line that is for faxes. I then used the device to copy results of patient evaluation sheets, and test results (one for office file one for patient). Also I printed out online lab results from the internet for various patients for their files and for the Doctor to see. Lastly I used the fax to handle pharmacy Rx refills. The MAXIFY worked flawlessly for all these functions. I then switched the unit out with the one regularly used in the office as I decided I did enough to satisfy my test of the functions of the Canon device.

I must say that I put this unit to every test possible and it performed with absolutely no problems. It a very good device at a reasonable price. The only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is the cost of the replacement ink. This is the only problem with the unit and it is unfortunate.

Turning the machine off then on allowed another copy to be printed then error code 5010 again. The printer still worked, just the copy/scan was out of service. I Read everything I could find on the net. Found the service manual and read it three times.

For error 5010 the service manual says: ""The scanner unit cannot detect the home position, or the scanner unit warming-up is not done properly at power-on. On the LCD, ""Scanner is not operating correctly."" is displayed."" The service manual says the scanner part in whole needs to be replaced ($150 from Canon, 2012).

Just because the canon service people don't take the scanner unit apart didn't deter me-it should have. I took the scanner apart being very careful not to move the scan head position for fear of timing issues. I got the lamp to blink on by jiggling it. So I added electrical tape to the lamp socket ends hoping it was a slight disconnection problem. Re-assembled and Tested it - still failed. Took it apart & I got some silicone oil and oiled the scan head rod and skid beam. Re-assembled & Still failed. Moved the scan head to access the rod and skid beam underneath. Carefully oiled both again. Re-assembled & failed again with New error code! 5020 ""scan head lock is locked"". (It was not locked. This is an analog locking device, the switch slides into a detent in the scan head.) The latest error prevents even printing. My printer is now completely unusable.

So I chalked up the scanner problem to the fact that the scan head does not move as it should for an unknown reason and the sensors error out before the lamp warms up. My time is worth more than the cost of a new printer/copy machine diveded by the 20 hours I had already spent. Hopefully my new Canon will fair better. They are made really well and the user manual was excellent.

These ink cartridges work well in my Brother MFC-465CN, although there are a couple quirks:
Instead of just hitting ""print,"" I now have to highlight what I'm going to print, then print, whether it be a coupon or a photo or a page of words.
Also, the first cartridge inserted leaked and had to be tossed (it did not leak into the printer).  The second cartridge needed a little coaxing and re-insertion.  Third and fourth cartridges were fine.
I did have to print maybe 5 pages to get the cartridges primed, but after that, the ink colours have appeared 99 percent true, and they dry properly with no smearing.  I'm using colour more often now!

Very stupidly designed.  There is a HOLD button on the base.  The base is great and has a large screen readout which is very nice.

But when I clicked on the button, it took me to the general Canon site where I was supposed to find my printer.  Apparently the iP4500 is so old already that it was not listed.  So I decided to review it anyway here on Amazon.
By way of full disclosure, I used laser printers for some 25 years and this Canon is my first  inkjet printer.  So it is not surprising that I find it very slow and very expensive to operate.  I only bought it because my wife wanted to copy some color pictures of  fashion.  The printer did a great job of copying the pictures and my wife was delighted.

As for my own use of the printer, my main complaint is that I cannot set the  defaults.  I would like the printer to be set  on grayscale and preview.  The default is OFF.  Sometimes the printer does stay on my sets, and other times it reverts to the default.  The  retrieve function requires too many keystrokes and does not  permanently set the functions.  All this becomes even more complicated when I use the printer with other software such as the Microsoft Photo-Ed.  I have  tried to work around the problem by creating additional ""printers""  in Control Panel but they don't work any better than the original.  My current operating system is Vista x64.

Otherwise the printer is excellent.

However, after using the printer for a while, I  discovered that it is much too expensive to operate.  I was naive enough to think that if I only used black ink, the cost would be tolerable. But the printer actually draws from the colored inks even when you use only black. During my third black cartridge one of the colored cartridges was used up which would mean another sixty bucks for a set.  So I put the Pixma aside and will use it only when colored printing is required.  I bought  a Brother 1240 Laser Printer for very little money and that is what I use for everyday printing.",Too expensive to operate,1234569600,,
4.0,False,"08 31, 2009",AJE80Y9ES2HOV,B001DJ6DH6,,Cool Breeze,"My old Canon Pixma iP4200 worked pretty well for three years (noisy, but I got used to that), but during the last 6 months, the print heads printed horizontal lines on photos and images, no matter how many times I ran the maintenance routines.

So I upgraded to the Pixma iP4600.  It's a little quieter; photos and images come out fine in highest resolution; and I like that it's now mostly black instead of gray.

One quibble, however.....  I load the cassette tray with pre-printed sheets (company logo, etc), and I use the rear tray for everything that goes on blank paper.  I switch back and forth between the two Paper Sources multiple times a day.  Most drop-down boxes enable you to slide your cursor down to your selection and just let go of the mouse button -- you don't have to click to open the box and then click again on your selection.  In other words, as you drag the cursor down the list of options, each option is highlighted and becomes the active button.  This was true of the printing software for the Canon iP4200.  But with the iP4600 (and the Printing Preferences window looks exactly the same), you have to click and click again (ditto the drop-down box for Media Type).  It won't let you just click, slide, and let go.  This is a minor annoyance, but even minor annoyances take on greater proportions when you are working fast.  Canon claims they deliberately removed this function from the iP4600.  I think that's baloney.  I think it's a glitch.","Good printer, but one little problem",1251676800,,

Once dried on paper it is bloody impossible to remove it, so bullet proof describes that pretty well. I am not as convinced about the blackness of the color. It seems more deep charcoal to me on the papers I'm used to using (copier paper). There is minimal feathering and the ink is fast drying. But there is some bleed-through if your pen is broader in the nib or if you nib pauses even a tiny bit in writing (top or bottom of strokes). So to avoid this, an extra fine nib, or one that is a bit ""drier"" is desirable; but these combinations accentuate the grayness too! So I am rating the ink down just one star for the color and the bleed-through on the cheap paper I like to use. The included pen is I think a Platinum Preppy that has been specially made for Noodler's as it has their logo instead of the nasty non-removable bar-code of Platinum pens. So I like it.

Most importantly, it supported both PC and Mac operating systems - not all do so it pays to check ahead of time. Unboxing and setup was very good as is typical for HP who really thinks these things through. Loading the software on my Sony SZ laptop was easy but the program is huge and loaded with lots of HP extras that had minimal value for me. Discovering the printer wirelessly on the network was quick and without incident which was good. Trying to print to the unit was another story as I could ""see"" the printer on the network and print a test page from the HP Toolbox but not print from any application including Wordpad which is one recommended by HP's Online Help. I did numerous uninstalls, reinstalls, loaded the latest drivers from HP's very helpful website to no avail. Lastly I spent almost two hours online with HP support and we tried dozens of things but nothing worked. My last resort was to baseline the SZ - a huge pain given the number of applications and necessary updates but good for system stability overall. I reloaded the HP software and it worked - my best guess is that something in the Windows XP Pro OS was corrupted and conflicting with the HP software. Now for the best part. Wifey's MacBook Pro was sitting in the den turned on and connected wirelessly to the network while I was struggling through the Windows install on the Sony SZ. I needed to print some business documents so I emailed the files to her account and went over to her computer to install the HP 6180 and try printing from there. I used the Mac print utility to discover the printer and it was already there. The software was already on the system and setup to print which it did flawlessly. I congratulated her on installing and configuring the software on her Mac however she claimed she didn't do anything. I was amazed. Until I received my new iMac this week. I set it up in the usual painless Mac way, installed the software from HP and it configured itself and was ready to go in less than 15 minutes. The print quality is very good and I like that I can replace individual ink cartridge colors as they deplete as opposed to an entire multi-color cartridge - the unit tells you which colors are low or in need of replacement - will even show up on your host computer as to what the individual ink levels are. Scanning is a bit slow but it works fine and the resolution is good. I haven't hooked up the FAX as the Time Warner VOIP phone system doesn't work with FAX machines. Overall, I really pleased with the unit and it's overall performance on the Mac systems and a bit less so on the PC systems given the interaction with the Windows OS and the size of the software install.",Flawless with Mac,1193184000,3,

Planners become records of your year, with all sorts of scribbled phone numbers, notes, clippings -- especially if there is ample space. I am a repeat buyer of this model -- and  I am very, very picky.

Perhaps you need a scheduler. This is fine for that. But the schedule intervals are also useful for budgeting your time -- I will work on this for two hours and NO LONGER. I will then turn my attention to the next thing. (Some of us really need help with task-switching.)

Attractively, there is a yellow-pad-like box at the top right of each two-day weekly spread. I don't know why this helps, but it does.

Each month has its own one-page planner.. It faces a glorious blank page for notes. There are extra notation pages at the back, along with a (useless to me) address book. Does anybody ever need another address book?

A double-sided pocket for papers completes the planner. It used to be sturdy clear plastic; now it's manila paper. Ah, the environment. The manufacturer is proud that this year's recyclable paper is stronger.

Repeat: I wouldn't recommend this for a scheduler, although it works as one. It is the best of a dwindling choice of PLANNERS. Don't choose yours because it's pretty. Think about what you want it to look like in December, and what you will want to have accomplished. Most of the pretty ones turn blank in February.

I used online Avery software for designing, and it was straightforward and easy to use.

Opened them in the Reader and everything printed fine. Do not forget to feed the sheets with the bottom side first, otherwise it prints incorrectly.
Then comes assembling. First, you need to separate strips of cards, you just need to fold the paper along fine perforated lines, be careful, since sometimes it wants to fold on the second perforated line that is holding the cards on the flyer. then apply strips of cards to the flyer.

So to use my calling card easily I had to use the calling card's speed dial feature.  Just another step.  I looked at other phones and came to the conclusion that Speed Dial is pretty much a thing of the past, so I decided to keep this phone.

Otherwise, I really like this phone.  It is a nice size, nice soft lighted keys, compact base.

It is easy to dispense and cut the tape and it grips the inside of the roll and requires just the right amount of tension so that the tape doesn't come out too fast.  It's also easy to change the roll.

I do have one major complaint:  the tape has a 1 1/2"" diameter core instead of the standard 3"" core so it won't work with the normal packing tape from a dollar or office supply store.  However, 1 1/2""  could become an industry standard and Scotch could make that happen.

It has one of those newfangled rubbery grips but it would also be nice if the handle were a little longer because it is more comfortable to put my thumb on top rather than to hold it in a fist as shown on the package and it is just a bit too short for that.  The mechanism, handle, and cover are also made out of crunchy polystyrene plastic like Tic Tac boxes which cracks and breaks easily and the sound of that gives me the willies.

Overall, I think this is more than adequate to keep around the house for casual users.

Physically, these pens are lighter and slightly thinner than a Pilot G2 Pro. I think the G2 Pro looks more attractive, but looks is probably not anyone's main consideration for buying this pen. It has a rubberized grip on the lower third. The G2 Pro may be easier to grip, as it is thicker - it felt more comfortable in my hand. Overall, well built, but nothing exceptional. Disassembles into 5 parts including refill and spring, if you're like me and fidgets with whatever is in my hands during a meeting.

It does write smoother an a ball point pen, In fact, it feels smoother than even a G2, much to my astonishment. I repeated this multiple times over several days, with 3 different G2 pens just to make sure I'm not hallucinating. I've always thought that the G2s are really smooth, but after writing with this pen, the G2 felt a bit scratchy.

The ink is richer and more vibrant than ball point pen, but it is not as even as a G2. If you examine the writing, you can see that the ink flow is not quite even - some parts are darker than others, and occasionally I'd even have very small sections where there's only ink in the outline. Not a big flaw, it is totally legible and doesn't distract from the writing. You have to peer closely at it to notice this. But the G2 does not have this issue.

The main flaw for me, however, is that in normal writing, it would leave tiny globs of ink on the paper. This is with normal writing, nothing to intentionally stress the pen, and happens even if I intentionally clean the tip before writing - in fact, that doesn't appear to make any difference at all. To see it at its worst, draw lots of loops. And that part smears very badly if you happen to rub on it. The rest of it can smear, but you need to rub on it within seconds of writing for it to smear. If you wait a minute or two, it doesn't smear. I'm left handed, and there are no ink smears on my hand from normal writing.

Perhaps the biggest advantage of this over a gel pen like a G2 is that it dries quickly and doesn't run if the paper happens to get wet. Gel ink takes a few hour to dry fully, after which it will not smudge when wet. I wrote on a piece of paper with a G2 and an Acroball, then within minutes, ran some water from a tap over the paper. The gel ink runs quite badly, and the Acroball is unaffected. No one intentionally brings their notes with them into the shower, of course, but if you get caught in the rain, at least you know your notes will not be all smudged, even if the paper is a total mess. By the way, if you wait a few hours (or overnight), the gel ink will not run either.

What really surprised me is that these pens cost about twice as much as the G2. Even though they are incredibly smooth to write with, the globs of ink is a real turn-off for me. I'm not sure if that is just an issue with a particular batch, but all 3 pens (different colors) exhibit this.

Bonus info : They won't write upside down (at least, not more than a few words). Neither will the G2. If you want an inexpensive pen that does (translate : not a Space Pen), try the Uni-Ball Power Tank RT. They don't write anywhere near as smooth or the ink is remotely as vibrant though.","They're extremely smooth, but I won't be giving up my G2 yet",1405468800,,

It is pretty much what you'd expect, as far as sturdiness- it isn't flimsy, but neither would I set something heavy (like a printer) on it.  The assembly was super-easy, and instructions were clear.  They even sent a few extra pieces of hardware (couple extra screws, an extra spacer, and an extra drawer knob).  It uses a hex and a phillips head (the hex comes with) for assembly.  My only complaint is that one of the drawers was broken on the edge when it came.  I called customer service right away (their number is printed on the instructions), and they were very nice and accommodating.  The gentleman said he'd send the replacement drawer right out to me.

Now I have never been entirely sure why people need light up pens aside from the fact that anything that can multitask is pretty cool, but obviously people do because there are lots of light up pens on the market.  In the interest of full disclosure I should tell you that I received these three pens for free because the Glovion company that sells them were looking for reliable folks to review them.  I like to think of myself as an honest and reliable reviewer but I guess you'll have to be the judge of that.

My criteria for giving a star rating to a pen is pretty straightforward....  I judge whether the pen is comfortable to hold, whether it is easy to operate and whether the ink is smooth.  Smooth ink is especially important to me.  I happen to love pens.  I used to have a collection of fine pens until someone stole them and broke my little pen loving heart.

This pen has a relatively thick barrel which I find hugely comfortable but some of you smaller handed people might not.  The ink is very smooth with no skipping that I could tell.  The point hovers between fine and medium.  The ink is black.  One reviewer wrote that it is difficult to change the pen cartridge.  I found it super easy -- pull off the bottom plastic, unscrew the cartridge, pull it out and screw in a new cartridge.  All accomplished in under 15 seconds.  LIkewise, the batteries are easy to replace as well.  The light is powered by 3 LR44 batteries.  I hate those tiny little things but they are everywhere so I guess I have to make peace with them.  The light is very bright.  I understand that it is meant to be used in dark rooms but you would be VERY conspicuous if you pulled this out in a dark room around other people.

One more nice feature?  These three pens come with three spare LR44 batteries and 3 spare ink cartridges.  That's a pretty sweet deal.

BOTTOM LINE:  A good pen with an unbelievably bright light built into the barrel.  Gets two thumbs up from me.

This gives a really neat old-school look if that's what you're going for and if you don't need the features found on most modern label makers.

The tape used by the DYMO is 3/8"" (it doesn't use other sizes, as far as I can tell) and includes 1 roll in the cost. For the price, about 8 bucks, it's a great bargain. The included tape is black (with white text) and about ~10 feet long.

The label maker is easy to use -- rotate the wheel to select your letter/symbol and squeeze the trigger. The letters/symbols included are:
A-Z (capitals only)
0-9
' "" ! # $ @ . , - /
There is also a ""blank space"" and a CUT button.

One thing to note is that each letter/symbol, regardless of size, uses the same amount of space. That means a letter like B uses the same spacing as a period. This leads to some odd-spacing you don't see on modern label makers.

So what other differences do you get from a modern label maker?
Most newer ones will allow you to change font, they'll print onto tape, you can adjust effects and re-print as needed. If you need to print 2 labels with the same text on this, you need to actually hand-label each of them.

I did not encounter any issues with letters not displaying properly on the tape, but I did squeeze the trigger hard each time I used it. If you're not squeezing it fully, you may experience issues.

This label is mostly for those wanting the old school retro/embossed look. For a couple dollars more you can get a modern label which will serve most people better. I specifically bought this for the old-school effect.

I will say I'm not a huge fan of the design. Blue, White and Green don't make the nicest appearance but that's a minor issue when it works and is very cheap.","Fun, Cheap, retro label maker",1469750400,,

Since it is a small model, it has a much smaller footprint making it easy to place anywhere. You can print directly from a smartphone, tablet, iPad, etc.  There is a 2.5 inch color LCD which walks you through set up and navigation. However, the pictorial instructions must be followed before using the LCD on the printer.

First, I must state that I am not a technical person. Usually, my husband helps me set up all the computer stuff including printers. For the sake of this review, I wanted to set it up from start to finish on my own to see if it is easy enough for the non-technical person. I loved the fact that it came with easy pictorial instructions.

I followed along pretty easily until it came to placing the ink cartridges. The pictures are not exactly clear and easy. The ink cartridges must be shaken prior to opening the package and then the picture is showing something which is actually just removing the yellow tabs and pulling them downward. Then you can place the ink cartridges into the printer. I chose to do the Cyan ink cartridge first and work my way to the Black cartridge because the others are smaller and I felt it might be more difficult in the other direction. The Cyan clicked in with ease and you distinctly hear it click in when put in accurately. The Magenta cartridge did not click in and it felt wedged. I was not sure if I put it in properly since it was so tight against the Cyan and I did not hear it click. When I tried to get the ink cartridge out, it was not letting me take it out. I had to ask my husband for help which I did not want to do. He had difficulties getting it out too so, he said it was not me like I had originally thought. He aligned the cartridge properly but he did not hear it click in either. He did say it was correctly positioned and to keep going which, I did.  I put in the other cartridges each one feeling very tight with no clicking sound.  It wound up ok though because the XP-420 checked to make sure that the cartridges were ok and then started to initialize which takes about 4 minutes.

However, you need to know that the Wi-Fi password that it asks for when connecting your network is case sensitive. It took me a couple of tries before I realized this. The Wi-Fi Wizard walked me through the rest of the steps and then I just had to insert the driver on my computer by using the disc.  The Wi-Fi set up can be done when you insert the disc and it will walk you through the process. I am sure either way is just as easy, however, it might be a tad easier on the computer because having to scroll through the letters and numbers on the actual printer was a bit lengthy and annoying.

Within minutes, the driver was set up, my product was registered, and the printer was ready to test. Now please note, the bigger models might easily align the paper and have less of a flimsy paper tray. This model if you do not correctly and perfectly align the paper, it does not print correctly. I feel that the paper tray is extremely flimsy. The guide for the paper width feels more sturdy than the tray.  As it fed the paper from that rear tray to the front, I noticed that there is nothing in the front to prevent the paper from flying out of the machine to the floor. I was not pleased with this so either I have to be there to catch it especially if it is printing a few pages or I need to make sure that it sits with something in front of it to catch the papers. I did not test the 100 page capacity like it claims but I am sure the paper tray can accommodate that many pages.

The sheets that I did print came out with beautiful and accurate colors. I have not tried the SD slot that can directly print your pictures from it. It does have a feature that allows you to scan photos or documents to place it on Facebook or the Cloud. For a small machine that is designed for smaller gadgets, it handles just as well as some of the bigger models. I am not sure how long the ink is going to last but I imagine the black will be the first to go.  The biggest drawback with this machine is the ink cartridges and the fact there is no real way to know if they are placed correctly unless you turn on the machine. Removal of the ink cartridges should not be so difficult.  I am not sure that I will be able to get them out myself without damaging something since you really have to yank it out after pulling up the tab. I also did not like the fact that there was nothing to make sure that the paper did not come flying out the front. I did love the capabilities of the XP-420 and the gorgeous colors it can produce. The photos that it prints bring out bold colors and are high quality. The set up was considerably easy even if you are non technical person and when you put the disc in, you can also load an instruction manual and register your product.",Thinks Big in a Small Package!,1433030400,2,

The shredder is indeed 100% jam proof, and it will accept 12 sheets, tops.  In fact, these are the features that I like the least.

This shredder has a sensor with a lighted display that shows Red (too many sheets inserted), Yellow (productivity is optimized), or Green (more sheets can be inserted).  If the sensor starts with Red, the shredder won't start.  If you insert flat sheets of paper, it will shred them quickly (though it will sometimes accept only 11 sheets).  With ordinary paper loads, the shredder will run continuously for 10 minutes of shredding.

However, if you insert unopened junk mail--which usually has lightweight card stock and paper inserts, in addition to regular letter paper--the shredder will start, but will halt with an overload soon after it begins to shred.  (Presumably the sensor sees the load differently once the layers are separated a little.)  This isn't really a problem, because the shredder will reverse and advance, reverse and advance, until it clears the jam all by itself.  However, the jam-proof feature slows the shredding process, because the shredder doesn't operate continuously.  (I'll admit that I'm hard on shredders, because I find it entertaining to try to get the maximum load in each shredder pass, and to try to get the shredding done in the shortest possible time.)

A nice feature of this FELLOWES 73Ci shredder is that it has both an on-off switch (at the back), and a lighted ""on"" panel (at the front).  You must touch the front panel to instantly light the display and start the shredder.  After 2 minutes of nonoperation, the lighted display automatically goes to sleep mode, which shuts down the shredder.  This display feature, along with the 12-sheet sensor that prevents needless paper jams, saves on energy.  Other nice features are the display lights that show when the bin is full or open, and the shredder's ""SafeSense"" technology that halts the shredder when hands touch the paper opening.

However, all of these electronic sensors and jam-clearing features come at a price:  the powered shredder ""lid"" that fits on top of the bin support is very heavy.  It is much heavier than the ""lid"" on my older 18-sheet Fellowes PS-14Cs cross-cut shredder, which also has the ""SafeSense"" technology (but not the sheet sensor or the sleep mode).  The two shredders cut identically-sized pieces that measure 1/4"" by 1-1/2"".  I actually like the older model better, because of the greater sheet capacity that makes shredding junk mail a breeze.

The FELLOWES 73Ci shredder's weight is offset by the fact that the bin (and ""lid"") support is equipped with casters.  Casters mean that the shredder is easily moved, and easy to shift around when the bin needs emptying.  The shredder blades are easy to maintain, needing only a little oil after each binful, squirted across the shredder opening.

This is actually my fifth Fellowes shredder.  I broke the first two, purchased many years ago when shredders first appeared in the office supply chain stores (e.g., Home Depot, Staples).  I overloaded and jammed them, and ruined the motors.  My third Fellowes shredder, a strip-cut model, performed admirably for many years--despite my continuing overload abuse.  It was finally replaced with this cross-cut shredder.  I donated the strip-cut shredder to Goodwill, and I hope it will continue to shred away for someone else who finds strip-cut shredding adequate.  My fourth Fellowes shredder, the 18-sheet cross-cut shredder already mentioned, is still in use in my home office, after 3-4 years of operation and some overload abuse.

Because the FELLOWS POWERSHRED 79Ci 100% JAM PROOF 12-SHEET shredder won't operate continuously when I shred unopened junk mail, I give it only 4 stars (""I like it"" on the official Amazon scale).  If you have light shredding needs, then this shredder is a great choice, because a cross-cut shredder gives good security, and is cheaper to buy and maintain than a diamond-cut shredder.  If you have moderate shredding needs, then you should probably consider a Fellowes shredder with a larger sheet capacity, such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fellowes-3229901-PowerShred-99Ci-17-Sheet-Cross-Cut-Shredder/dp/B000YGO7HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fellowes 3229901 PowerShred 99Ci 17 Sheet Cross-Cut Shredder</a>&nbsp;(slightly more expensive, with many similar features including jam-proof technology, but lacking the energy-saving feature).",100% Jam Proof Feature Works Too Well!,1366934400,42,

The ink is a nice, colorful, vibrant color. The ink is not as thick as the Sakura Gelly Rolls, which is a plus for some coloring designs. The ink dries fast. The padded cushion grips are more comfortable then the rest of the pens.
I had 1 or 2 that had to be scribbled in order to get the pen going, which is a big plus. No skipping or dragging on my paper (copy paper). I am not a fan of the neon or metallic colors, I don't like any gel pens with neon or metallic colors; I give them to my grand kids.
If I remember correctly, there was a brown colored pen that was unique to the other gel pens set's that I have bought over the last few months. And that is a big plus to me, who would have guessed that a brown is hard to come by.  I've learned it is as hard to find as a real red.
I liked these pens so much that I bought the bigger set for my daughter. I know she will love them when she receives them.
Off all the gel pen set's I have bought over the last few months, I like these alot. Not as much as my Sakura Gelly Rolls, but a close second. Gelly Roll will always be at the top of my gel pen list.
My recommendation is this:
If your looking for a good set of gel pens, pens that have nice color to them, do not skip or drag on paper, pens that do not stop after a few minutes of use, then these are the pens for you. The ink levels are holding up pretty well to my amount of use. I've used these alot over the last few weeks, and I have not had any problems with them.

4.0,False,"12 9, 2009",AJH56SEX96IH4,B000WR0CKE,,David Bland,"My background: I'm a long time Pocket PC user and the 211 replaces my faithful but low-end Dell Axiom x30, and prior to that I was a long time Palm user.  My Axim started doing strange things and it was time for a replacement.  I wanted an excellent PDA that also worked well as a media device (mainly for music but also for movies which I rip from DVD).  I like stylus input with handwriting recognition and am more than happy with a separate, smaler mobile phone (which is why I didn't get a Blackberry).  I've had this unit for about 3 weeks and have used it a LOT.

Pros:
1. The 211 and the IPAQ 111 are the only game in town if you want a non-phone PDA.  I don't think Palm sells them anymore and only HP still offers a Pocket PC device.  ***This is the single biggest reason to buy this unit***
2. Outstanding, huge screen with vibrant colors
3. Stylus input with handwriting recognition, assuming you like that versus using a keyboard or fingers
4. Adequate as a media device if all you need to play are mp3 and windows media files audio files.  Media Player does not support lots of codecs, doesn't have a pre-amp to control treble & base, and in spite of what the documentation says, you can't reprogram the buttons.  However, this Media Player is a big improvement over the one that came with Windows Mobile 2003 on my Axim -- that version was unusable.  Microsoft claims you can use Media Player to sync files, similar to the way iTunes works, but as this feature never worked on under Windows Moble 2003, I long ago gave up and simply copy files onto my SD card myself and that works fine.  However, if you have a big SDHC card with lots of files, it looks like it takes a long time for WMP to update its library
5. Takes SDHC and CF cards.  You can really load a lot of storage on this unit.  I have a 32gb SDHC card
6. Excellent feel and size.  It feels solid and even though it's a ""large"" unit, most of the increase is in the length.  It still fits easily into my shirt pocket -- even in a leather case!  And I can stick into my pants pocket easily too.
7. WiFi setup is a snap and mobile IE is OK -- much better than I expected, in fact (I expected the worst!).  I tried the Skyfire mobile browser expecting IE to come out second but there was no comparison, IE was vastly better.  The Opera Mobile browser (free) has some nice features and may be a better choice than IE in the long run, but I don't really need internet access on my PDA

Cons, in no particular order (but they are the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5)
- Windows Mobile 6 is a bit clumsy and to my surprise requires somewhat more taps to do things than WM 2003 (eg, to edit a calendar entry requires one more tap than WM 203) -- but this isn't a big deal, just a minor irritant that I've gotten used to already

- Not blazingly fast.  I say this because the 211 has a fast processor and many reviewers have commented on that fact.  I expected a more zippy feel to it but I don't see it.  Not that it's slow (but see next point), but it doesn't feel fast either.  I take this to be due to Microsoft bloat, not HP

- Noticeably slow opening a big word document.  No idea why but my old, slow, Axim x30 was much faster in this regard.  And it's not that big a document I'm opening, either, only 616 words and 39K

- Can't reprogram all buttons.  On my old Axim, I could reset any button to any function, but on this IPAQ, you can't reset buttons 2 or 3.  I find this very annoying (you can reset ""Hold Button 3"" but not Button 3).  Don't know if it's an HP limitation or Microsoft's

- Windows Media Player (WMP) is lame:
(1) can't reset any buttons at all -- in spite of the fact that it claims to be able to reset any button!  I find this very, very annoying.
(2) playback of video files is terrible.  I rip DVDs to ASF or WMV format and they play back beautifully on my PC but on WMP Mobile (on the Ipaq) it's so jerky that it's unwatchable.  I was afraid it was the Ipaq itself but no -- when I installed my old friend, the TCPMP player (which I used for years on my Axim) it played back magnificently.  Clearly Microsoft just failed to put out a quality player -- shame on them.  No wonder people buy Ipods.

- Weird syncing problem with Outlook 2003 -- I have to have Outlook open in order for my Notes to sync.  Otherwise I get an error syncing Notes. I see no reason to upgrade my outlook, which I guess would fix the problem(?)

OTHER THOUGHTS:
Audio jack on bottom is OK.  I mention this because so many other reviewers mention the strange position of the audio jack on the bottom.  This simply is not an issue, though I was afraid it would be.  I often slip the unit into my pocket (shirt or pants) while connected and I just slip it in top first so the jack sticks up, and this is with a leather flip case, too.

Speakers.  Many of the reviews I saw talk about the poor quality of the speakers and how they are on the back of the unit.  So what?  Does anyone use this as a stereo replacement?  Audio recording playback of voices is just fine (I don't use this feature myself but I did test it out).  And who does not use earphones listening to music on a personal media device?  The sound quality out the earphone jack is excellent, the sound quality from the speaker is what you'd expect from a tiny little speaker.  I just don't understand this criticism.

I don't use Bluetooth so I can't comment on that

I haven't used it long enough to really run the battery down but just from listening to music for several hours I can tell that the battery life is very good

I agree with everyone else that this screen requires more pressure.  I got used to it quickly, it's not an issue IMO

The clamp that holds this on to any sort of table/desk top or counter top is so tiny it will barely attach to anything, and if you are lucky enough to have a solid surface thin enough to hold the clamp  it will come loose and the sharpener won't stay in place.  It does sharpen to a beautiful crisp extra sharp point when I can get it working/stable enough to even use it.....

I would like to add a few more stars on this review.  I took the advice of some of the people who answered my question and yes, it is easy to use without the clamp, just push the button slide the pencil in and crank, must hold pressure on top of the sharper with your other hand.  Also the person who mentioned cranking in reverse, that reverse symbol where the crank is, is not for reversing the crank but turning that little silver knob to the left as far as possible, that will adjust the sharpness of the pencil.  I originally thought it needed to be cranked in reverse also, but after a while I figured it out.

After reading Consumer Reports and these Amazon reviews, I bought the AT&T DECT 6.0 Digital 4-Handset, plus a fifth AT&T DECT 6.0 Accessory Handset from Amazon. Oddly, my local major AT&T store does not stock these phones. These phones work great with U-verse VoIP (or normal copper lines).

Good:

1. The phones are compact and light, though I find the silver finish rather cheesy-looking.

2. Sound quality is excellent, phones were ready to go (after a lengthy charging), and instructions are fairly readable.

3. The extra accessory handset requires one additional step so it would ""link"" to the rest of the system, but it isn't too confusing and it is good to go.

4. The answering machine works fine, and I changed the default message without problem.

Minor gripes:

1. the base unit can be mounted on the wall, but they did not include mounting screws or sheet rock anchors. How much would that cost; maybe 5 cents?

2. the handset bases are nice and small, but they cannot be mounted to the wall. This would have been an easy design option, but the designers did not bother. All these lightweight units are just sitting around cluttering tables and waiting to be knocked off instead of being safely mounted on vertical surfaces.

3. all the batteries arrived about 98 percent drained and take about 16 hours to charge.

4. handset causes an annoying ""buzz"" whenever it is near my computer's sound system. In all fairness, it is probably a grounding issue with my computer's speakers.

Overall a good, inexpensive system slightly flawed by AT&T's sloppy corporate mentality.",Works with U-verse VoIP; some minor gripes.,1307750400,,

To get around the problem of having students constantly wanting to get out of their seats to sharpen their pencils, I implemented a policy whereby students aren't allowed to sharpen their pencils in my class. Instead, they can trade in their blunt pencils for a sharpened one. This also prevented them from causing too much wear and tear to my pencil sharpener. This Stanley Bostitch pencil sharpener is an excellent machine. It has a strong motor that sharpens pencils really quickly.

The one flaw here is that the sharpener doesn't have an auto sense to stop after a pencil is sharpened. This is why I sharpen the pencils - the students would get carried away, not pay attention, and before you know it, their pencils would be 'eaten'.

As other reviewers have said, this can help organize cosmetics or travel toiletries, a shaver and accessories, or other personal items.  I found the smaller case able to hold an external drive with its cables pretty nicely.  The larger case has enough flexibility with the included dividers to handle a bunch of different things.

I really do think the cases are well made, with heavy duty nylon, good zippers, and padding throughout.  Even the carry handles, typically an afterthought on cases of this size, are well attached and secure.  These cases look to be durable and able to last for a long time.

Now that that's out of the way, I like this overall.  The biggest problem (as reported by so many others) is the lack of precision edging on the letters.  It's better than my handwritten ones, but if Brother didn't annoy me so very much with wasted tape, I would have gone with them.  As to the difficulty in operating, I think it's quite easy.  One reviewer mentioned having to go through a few steps to set different size fonts on different lines.  Yes, you do have to push a few buttons for that, nothing major.  But when I read someone else had to get out a manual to even capitalize a letter, I laughed.  There's a little ""a"" with an arrow pointing to a big ""A"", just push that and the letter is capitalized, then push it again to go back to lower-case.  Most of the buttons are self-explanatory like this.  The button with the frame around the letters lets you choose a frame.  The button with the letter A in different fonts lets you pick a font.  The button that has two different-sized capital A's controls the font size.  It's not rocket science.

I think it does a great job of keeping the waste way down.  The unit has a nice feel to it, and the buttons are easy to press.  The preview feature doesn't really give an actual preview of what will be printing out, but that's not a big deal to me.  I love the backlight on it.  I haven't had a chance to try out every single setting, but I have played around with character and margin widths, multiple lines and a couple other things.  Cartridges are pretty easy to put in and remove.  You do need to take up excess tape by rolling it (a la old cassette tapes) or it won't print right.  I like the many choices of kinds of tape.  Clear is great but if you have semi-clear containers, you'll probably want a white or black background on your tape.  The choices of fonts are fine, but some are more pixelated than others.  As mentioned previously, this really isn't a great look.  Not sure why Epson doesn't fix this as it's such a huge turnoff for so many people.  I don't have a problem with Epson tape.  It sticks on anything for me, even after removing and repositioning several times.  It's very easy to take off, but doesn't peel or curl up on its own.  I read someone somewhere complaining of labelers that didn't use split tape.  I don't know which brand that was, but this was does use split tape which makes it much easier to remove the backing.  Use a gentle hand though because the tape is so fine, you can easily crease it down the middle while removing the backing.

I would get a Brother label maker and pay even MORE for Brother tape if they would make a machine that didn't waste it.  It's partially about the money, but it's mostly that it just irritates me.  I know they know about this problem but refuse to fix it.  As it is, I'll put up with the poor type on this and just stand back farther to read my labels.

Right in the title, these are ""mini"" pens.  If you don't want a mini pen (shorter than a regular pen) look elsewhere.

The plastic arms on the side of the pen that hold the pen in your shirt pocket or other location are a little brittle.  If you fiddle with your pens at all and pull on these the arms will easily crack.  However, I think if you're using the pens normally it should be find.  The only concern is if you slide the pen onto a thick surface the arm will break.

First of all, they are designed to hand label with a permanent marker (like a Sharpie.) I love that because for so many tasks, it's troublesome to go to the computer, pull up the right template, load a sheet of labels in the printer and then print a label or two. Having these lets me write and apply a label instantly. Also, because Sharpies are available in a rainbow of ink colors, I can assign different colors to different items needing labels.

The labels themselves have a super strong adhesive and they really will stick to almost any surface with strong adhesion.

The labels have a semi gloss surface and take the permanent ink well. The labels themselves are very scrub resistant and water resistant however, with effort, you can scrub off much of the permanent ink. If you've ever used Sharpies, you know this is true. The only time permanent ink is really 100% permanent is if you get it on fabric (especially costly, prized fabric. LOL) However, it holds up pretty well under normal circumstances and way better than ordinary markers or ball point pens.

I have the 1 1/4"" x 3 1/2"" labels, which come 40 to a package. It's plenty big enough for most labeling jobs and I like that it comes in a small, plastic package that you can open and close easily. It fits in my catch-all drawer very well so they are handy when I need them.

The first five pages feature a peel and stick section.  The child would first take strips of different colored papers and cut them into small squares then, after peeling away one section, fill it with the confetti, like a mosaic.  The remainder of the page can be colored with markers or crayons so on one page the activities include coloring, cutting, pasting, eye-hand coordination.  A clever parent could take it further by introducing the color wheel or even show the child some photographs of mosaic throughout history.

The next few pages offer a variety of scenes from a beach scene to a fence in front of a cow.  In the back of the book are boldly colored sheets of paper with shapes to cut out and glue onto the page to create simple scenes.  A circle and eight rectangles cut from the yellow sheet are used to create a sun in the sky.  The parent can obviously discuss shapes and encourage the child to mix and match the shapes and/or colors before gluing them down.  A series of circles glued side-by-side create a caterpillar.

The opportunity for the child and parent to take the basic ideas and play with them is there.  A pile of construction paper cut into various shapes--from triangles to squares, circles and rectangles--can be shuffled around to see what the child can see or make.  Don't we all start with a house that is made up of a square, a triangle (for the roof) and a few well placed rectangles for windows and a door?  A bunny made of circles.

The metal ring can be removed from the hard plastic cover.  The binder has a leather appearance, resplendent with stitching.  It is a unique binder that will stand out from all others.  The binder is available in three muted, old-fashioned colors of brown, pink and green.

  The binder really doesn't need customizing.  It would be a shame to print out a customized piece of paper from the many templates available from wilsonjones.com and tape or paste it on the beautiful cover.  There is one plastic pocket on the inside of the front cover; however it is intended for a business card and perhaps a few notes or other small items.  Wilson Jones makes many index dividers that have an old-fashioned appearance and would look great in these binders.

  As for me, I prefer the Wilson Jones Heavy Duty D-Ring View Binders with Extra Durable Hinges.  These strong, sturdy binders are easy to customize and will hold more sheets of paper than ordinary round ring binders of the same size.  They are suitable for both home and office use.  However, for those who like to recycle, the Wilson Jones Durable Hinge Poly Binder (W31922) is a great option.

It prints, copies and scans.  It will also print from your smartphone, which I love!  It has a separate paper tray for photo-sized printing (4x6 & 5x7).  You can plug your camera card directly into the printer, which makes it very easy to upload your photos.

Wifi setup wasn't too difficult.  The instructions offer two processes for Wifi setup.  One method involves having a printer cable, and the other involves using the screen setup on the printer.  I didn't have a printer cable, so I used the screen, and even though it was probably slower, it worked effectively.

The copy function is simple.  The copier screen allows you to choose color or black and white, choose the number or copies (up to 99), and choose two-sided copies.  When printing two-sided copies, the ink on the front of the paper smears unless you let it dry for a bit.

I give this a 4 star rating.  I also have a Canon printer, and it was actually easier to set up than this one.  If that had not been the case, I would have given this one a 5.

In reality this shouldn't need much in the way of directions, but if it is going to include them, well, those directions need to be clear and to the point and they should clearly note what everything that came in the package is for and where it would be used.  Minus a couple of star fragments in the review for that (somewhat) failing.

In terms of does this device work the answer is clearly yes.  You put it together, put it in the intended spot and put your monitor on top of it and you're done.  It gives you some additional space below the monitor that will stand on it and helps to raise that monitor to a more appropriate viewing height.  If the monitor you have is on a stand that is fixed height (we use a bunch of fairly inexpensive Acer monitors at my work, all of which are on such stands) this can be of great benefit.

For me, this piece of equipment somewhat replaces an older monitor stand that I had been using.  That being one of these: (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Allsop-Metal-Art-Monitor-Stand-Black/dp/B003M2YDE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Allsop Metal Art Monitor Stand (Black)</a>&nbsp;or one very similar).  I like the Allsop stand though I would note that it seems to have always been ""bent"" a little with the shelve that the monitor is supposed to sit on always tilted forward rather than sitting level.  The design of this Fellowes monitor riser precludes that from happening as the flat surface is equally supported on 3 legs.  Having the back leg for this riser may make it less convenient to put items under the stand/monitor, but there is still a decent amount of space under there to place things.

In the end this seems to be useful piece of equipment that is priced reasonably enough to make it worth recommending for those that need something like it.","Works like it is supposed to, directions could be better",1296691200,2,

I will say that, on my Windows 8 platform, the wireless setup went anything but smoothly.  First, they send an installation disc but don't let you know it's worthless for Win8 and to just go to their website to d/l and install the drivers, etc. there.  THAT would've been helpful!  Second, as some other reviewers have stated, my wireless was hooked up and running and then just suddenly stopped (my network could no longer recognize the printer).  I printed out all reports that said the connection was fine, but it wasn't.  Third, and others have stated this, the initial toner that comes with the printer won't last long - but it's NOT suppose to!  If you read the information that comes with the printer, it clearly states that the toner included has shorter lifespan (guessing due to shelf life, sitting in a warehouse inside the printer waiting to be shipped).

I ended up having to call Brother International - and that they are - INTERNATIONAL - the person you get obviously does not speak English as their primary language.  It was a short call (thank goodness), but the tech support guy was short and snippy and I let him know I didn't appreciate that, on top of him not speaking proper English.

Brother's website also doesn't allow you to change your model after you have registered.  For example, I had a previous Brother and it was already on my account.  It was no longer in use due to being zapped by lightning, but their site doesn't allow me to remove it from my profile and they can't either.  That makes absolutely no sense and is frustrating because the default machine that comes up on your profile is the first one you set up (in my case, the one that doesn't exist!).

There are no consumables to replace (like with printers) and the scanner appears to require zero regular maintenance.  Only a power/feed button exists on the scanner, with all remaining controls embedded in the software.  There are two moveable paper guides to keep your scans from jamming.  Tne guides snap back in palce to protect the interior of the scanner.  Two minor gripes:

1)  Feeding the first page is sometimes hit-or-miss.  It might catch only the corner and run through at an angle.  It also seems to have a dislike of very thin printer paper.  Once you get the hang of the first ""feed"" you should do fine.

2)  There is an optional case to carry or store your scanner.  That is a good idea, but I feel it is WAY overpriced for what you get.  Unfortunately, there is no third-party market that I could find, so your are sort of stuck with the OEM part.

Note that - for most people - scanning a standard size page (8-1/2 x 11 inches) requires no special settings.  But should you be scanning a legal size document (8-1/2 by 14 inches), you'll need to make sure it is plugged into a high0speed USB 3.0 port.  The software seems to have a problem with the 14-inch size if you are connected via USB 2.0.

Some of them are more cute and on-trend and others feel out of date and remind me of the styles of things I remembered seeing in a Print Shop type program 15 years ago. I do wish the aesthetics of their designs were more on par with templates I've seen for sale on Etsy or available for free on blogs.  If you have a certain aesthetic in mind you may want to peek at Avery's library before purchasing to see if you find something you like.  Once you do find a style I do think Avery makes it intuitive to personalize your design, which I appreciate, and I like that you can design and print online so no software is necessary.

Overall, I'm quite impressed with these.  I think that the quality of the paper is good, the online design and print experience is intuitive, and there is a good range of designs available.  I only wish that more of the designs were on par with things I've seen on blogs and Etsy.",High quality and easy to customize online,1426291200,,

I have a P-Touch label maker that I have used forever to create labels for my file folders.  Rather than hand-writing, I print the label, then peel the adhesive strip to the file folder and I do like that my labels have a uniform look.  What detracts from this system is that my labels are printed on white, so once adhered to the file folder, the label as well as the text is clearly visible.  What sets the Avery labels apart is that the label itself is clear.  Thus, it is virtually invisible once it is adhered.  This adds a very professional look to the labels, in addition to the uniform look.

However the reason I said in the title that they are best for business use?  The label sheets can be run through your printer which will print the whole page at once.  Prior to their arrival I didn't think this would be a problem, as I could just print a few, then save the sheet and next time I needed labels, print a few more.  Nuh-uh.  The sheet can ONLY be run through the printer one time, due to the adhesive residue on the page that will gum up the printer.  This means I need to know ahead of time what labels I will need for all 50 labels!  Now granted, if I were starting a new project of some kind, that wouldn't be a problem.  But generally I need to create only a few labels at a time - and I don't want to wait months until I have 50 labels that need printed!  For this reason, I downgraded my rating to a 4.

The software templates available online make it easy to create the labels.  You can even add a graphic, such as a logo, to the label.  When I saw the suggestion that you can print a label for both sides of the divider at once, I could not at first see how this would be useful.  However I now realize how handy it is to have both sides of the divider labeled.  Now, no matter where I am in the binder, I can easily flip to the section I need.  (This feature means I only have to wait until I need to print 25 labels, instead of 50, before printing the whole sheet.  It also means I go through twice as many labels.)

Another nice feature is that rather than having to peel and stick individual labels, it is easy to label a whole strip of five at once.  You simply line them up, stick down the labels, then when you remove the ""outer"" strip, all that is left is the labels on the dividers.

The dividers themselves are flimsier than I would prefer.  Thicker than paper but not as rigid as a good cardstock.  The corners are sharp rather than rounded.  So far this hasn't been a problem, although I can see them getting turned over and creased more easily.  The hole side is reinforced and so far has held up well.

Overall this is a good product but I do believe its best application is in a business setting where multiple labels are frequently required.",Great office product - not so good for personal use,1285200000,,
4.0,True,"03 6, 2017",A2FNA5903D9E6Y,B01E5T7HLQ,,Carol T.,"Call me a dinosaur but I still like a paper calendar. And I like one that has two years so I can look back or forward. This is strictly a calendar style (boxes), which is exactly what I like  calendars with lines and notes are just too overwhelming. Just give me a blank white box and Im happy. I can write what I want, freely.

Each two pages are a calendar spread. Theres the standard time zone map as well as an area code chart, a few pages for charts and a few telephone pages, which, in my opinion are useless since we all now pretty much keep our phone numbers in our phones. Id rather have a few more note pages because those I actually use on occasion. But, for dinosaurs who still use a phone book, I guess this section does have a purpose.

What I didn't know about these calendars is that they are made with 30% post-consumer waste recycled material. I really like that and hopefully, it will become a higher percentage over time. The cover is kind of like a nice vinyl paper (faux leather look) that won't rip while getting tossed about in my purse haphazardly, which I really appreciate since I have to carry this around for two years.

The size is perfect for me  approximately 4 x 6 inches. The  only complaint I really have is that Saturday and Sunday share a box on the far right column and I only have half a box to use when weekends are sometimes busier than weekdays. I like seven boxes beginning with Sunday on the far left and ending with Saturday on the far right.

I'm use to it now but wanted to note that in this review.

Looking for the perfect one, and after reading many reviews of this and other pencil, I decided to cough up some money and give them a shot.  I'm really happy I did, even if I plan never buy one ever again.

These are the smoothest-easiest pencils I've ever used. Both the 602 and the regular Blackwing sharpen perfectly and the graphite is very dark and consistent. They may not keep a point as well as harder pencils I've tried (mostly German), but I really did not mind that when taking in consideration how incredibly well they write. Overall they keep their point better than most ""HB"" pencils I've used. As a bonus, it comes with a very good eraser that can be adjusted and use to the end. But most of all, it is impossible to ignore the way they rounded it's hexagonal shape which makes for an extremely comfortable writing experience. I've ordered and tried tens of pencils stopping just short of buying Uni ball's Hi-Unis and Graf-von pencils, and these are simply the best.

Why only four stars if they are the best I've tried?

They are good, but they are not $22 a dozen good. Especially when you can find almost identical performance from a pencil costing $10 per dozen less. Now, don't get me wrong, you won't find this kind of quality and performance out of your ""high end"" Dixon Triconderoga Black or your office supply brand pencil-- not even close. But for about a dollar a pencil you can go with the Palomino ""HB"" pencil and you will be basically buying the same pencil (minus the cool looking eraser and the name and aura of the Blackwing pedigree) and never, or almost never notice the difference. And for much, MUCH less you can order Palomino's Golden Bear (and even their Prospector model) and have a quality writing tool for everyday use. No, they will not be Blackwings, but you will end up having a pencil that will rival any of the offerings from the more expensive Faber Castell, Staedtler, and Koh-I-Noor at a fraction of the cost.

These Blackwings are truly a work of art. And if you are a heavy pencil user, someone who really wants to impress your hipster friends, or just think these pencils will make you the next Steinbeck, then you should really give them a try at least once. I'm pretty sure that like me, you have spend at some point way more than $20 on something way less productive than pencils.

The AG-7 has a very pretty design, all gentle curves. It has great weight and is very, very well constructed. By that I mean the body is rigid, it has no wiggle or tendency to unscrew itself during use. The clip is strong and keeps the pen from rolling off the table.

The mechanism is strong and has a great, sharp click. You use the bottom on the end to extend the tip, 'CLICK', and a button on the side of the upper barrel to retract it, 'CLACK.'

It writes well, as well or better than any other ballpoint. The ink dries instantly, which is very important to lefties, like me.

The details are amazing. A lot of thought went into this thing. It is a marvel of design while maintaining cool 60s style and zero compromise engineering.

I decided to be more minimalistic with my pencil case and so I carry less pens and only bring ones that I ACTUALLY use. This is good because now I can fit my scientific calculator, little pouch of post its and page flags, glue stick, mini stapler, pencil sharpener, and random things. This is a truly carry it all pouch. The material is kind of plasticky and tough. It feels like a tarp feels like. I get so many compliments at school from this pouch. Everyone looks twice and laughs a lot! I would totally reccomend this pouch for anyone with a large and messy purse or backpack, is traveling light, needs for a bit of organization, needs a large yet well sized pencil pouch, or just needs something to carry everything in a portable fashion! I had so much trouble choosing which pouch I wanted because they were all so funny and cute. I chose the 'random crap' one because it was hilarious and representative of me as a person and it wasn't too inappropriate for school/public use.
It's been a week or so since I've started using it and it's been holding up pretty well the front and back seem to have a more worn feel(it looks the same) but I'm not sure if that's my fault or if it's the packages fault. I don't really mind because it's a thin sheet of plastic like material and it's bound to become more flexible than rigid!

It goes on totally clear on most paper, it is very strong, and the matte finish doesn't easily reflect light so it doesn't draw attention to itself.

The brand name ""Scotch"" has become a ""proprietary eponym"" for this type of clear tape, along the same lines as Band-Aid, Kleenex, and Saran wrap for their respective products. This generally happens only when a product is the best of its kind and has become the de-facto standard. This is certainly the case for Scotch Tape.

This one, however, really impressed me.  The place where my 11 year old always ends up ripping it apart is on the top of the expanding accordion sides.  This one really does have things in place to help prevent his normal wear and tear from literally ripping this to pieces.  The ends of the accordion part that attach to the front and rear ""cover"" pieces on here aren't just the little plastic weld kind of melted connection - they have that, as well as a plastic rivet to help keep it in place.  Then they went one step further, and there's material, actual material, sewn in across the top of those accordion sides.  So you can't just break the plastic of the accordion side, you'd have to actually cut the fabric on top.

The flap is held by a bit of elastic, and I wish that had a little extra ""snugness"" to it, but they designed it to be snug when it's fuller, not empty.  It'll hold shut, I just prefer a little more tension holding things shut when it's not bulging, but is still pretty flat.

So this definitely earns 5 stars from me, having seen what my son does to these things in the past, this one has addressed the two weakest points that he always broke in the past.  No more staples holding the front cover to the accordion sides anymore.",Wonderfully reinforced JUST where my son always breaks these things,1439251200,,

These binders are perfect for everything. The easy slide-in covers and spine definitely put these a step above other binders.  But that depends on how wide you need your inserts to be. I used the binders of other brands with tight plastic, but in those cases I would just cut the inserts a smaller width. But this binder will accomodate inserts of 1"" width for the spine and 9.5"" width for the front cover.

SIZE: 10.25"" x 11.5"" Easily accommodates 8.5 x 11"" sheets.

QUALITY: The quality is the same as other quality binders. The inside has plastic pockets on both sides. The binder rings are quality metal, and the binder clips are the smaller size but appropriate for a 1"" binder. The rings match up perfectly to college ruled paper.

INSERTS: The spine plastic isn't tight, so it is very easy to slide in spine inserts as wide as 1"".  The top of the spine plastic has a cutout to allow your finger to pull out the insert if necessary. The front cover insert can be up to 9.5"" and still slide in easily. Back cover will allow inserts 9"" wide or less (due to the two metal screws/locks holding the binder clip/rings in place.

I love the fact that we have the whole month calendar view and then the individual dates with space to write our  notes. It feels good quality. It's pretty, too. In all honesty, I first got this planner because of the cute color. Didn't care much for the poetica/quote aspect. But I actually really like that now. When I'm stressed out seeing how next week's gonna be, or jotting down everything I have to do, I just look at the top of the page and see a really nice and thoughtful quote. It's quite peaceful and I really appreciate it. The calming pastel colors are aesthetically pleasing. The ONLY con, and it's not even much of a con, is the act that if you carry this in a backpack or everywhere else, it's bound to get dirty. I don't leave the planner on my desk; it goes wherever I go. It falls on the floor. Coffee gets on it. Oh well.  At the end of 2015, the outside of the planner wasn't mint green anymore. It was like grey and brown mixed with green. I don't care though. It's what's inside that counts.

1. These are a good value at half the price of Post It brand ones.
2. Their finish is more visibly matte (preferable) than the competitor's brand. This makes writing on the flag just as easy as the more expensive brand. In contrast, office store branded flags (think: Stapl*s and Off*** M*x have a shiniy finish that is not friendly to writing on them with any pen other than a Sharpie)
3. They have a flat plastic clip like thing on the back that allows you to attach them to a page...Post IT used to have it on its flags but no longer does.

CON:

1. The only downside is that the dispenser does not have the transparent plastic so that only one flag dispenses at a time at the middle of the flag holder.

Sometimes I forget to recap the markers, so now just a simple""click"". All 8 colors show up very well on the nail designs so far. And on my granddaughter's tiny fingernails the nail art has become even easier.
*NOTE* to anyone interested in using sharpies for nail nail art, I have been doing my own nails for many many years. Start out applying at least two coats of base coat. I use ORLY'S RUBBERIZED BONDER, it's the best. Add your polish , or if not using polish sharpie on your nail art idea. Let it dry well, waiting about 3 to 5 minutes ( I do). Next apply your top coat, I use OUT THE DOOR FAST DRYING.
Having a generous amount on the brush , very lightly apply it straight down the center of your nail, then the other two sides , lightly. Try to make sure not to push hard on your nail art. Let it dry, then apply a second coat. ( that's how I do it). Sorry for rambling , but that's one of many ways I choose to use these sharpies.

My previous solution was an Aurora 8-sheet shredder, which broke after a couple of years of light use. So far this Swingline shredder has been fantastic. It looks and sounds a lot more durable than the Aurora shredder. The overheating sensor is a great feature to protect the mechanism, but so far I have never caused it to trigger. I'm careful to shred no more than 14 sheets at a time so I don't stress the shredder and wear it out prematurely. The pull out tray is designed well. Inevitably you will end up with a few strips of paper on the floor that you will have to clean up, but I haven't yet seen a shredder that avoids this problem. The shredder looks good (for a shredder!) and I have not yet had a paper jam, which is something I had to deal with a lot with my Aurora shredder.

I haven't used the CD/DVD side of the shredder yet, but it has a separate tray so you don't mix the sliced CDs with the paper - this is important if you recycle the paper (although in my part of the world, my local recycling facilities do not want shredded paper - so be sure to check if you can recycle the paper scraps where you live).

All of my professors required them, and definitely for good reason. They are not, however, the best pencil choice for beginners. All of the negative reviews I've read seem to be from those who are new to drawing and are frustrated with broken tips, the core falling out, etc. If used properly, none of those things will happen.

My humble advice from my own experience is this: buying these pencils before learning proper blending techniques and the ideal amount of pressure will result in heavy-handed drawing and considerable frustration from broken tips. It's kind of like buying a $100k sports car to use while learning how to drive. Prismacolor's line of Scholar colored pencils are definitely the way to go if you're just starting out. Or, better yet, just buy a super cheap hard-tipped pencil set to have fun with and learn with. And then, once you've mastered the basics, proceed with buying an expensive, soft-core brand.

Learning how to use colored pencils without pressing too hard, etc., is only half the equation, though. The other technique to master is how best to sharpen these pencils. Without the right sharpener, you'll end up with weak tips that'll break with even the softest pressure, and even more frustrating, you'll lose large chunks of lead by stripping the wood and thus loosening the seal between the core and shell. From my experience, there is a German company that makes a sharpener that is extremely inexpensive and yet performs even better than the one made by Prismacolor. It's made out of wood and the blade is extremely sharp, so you'll get really great tips that won't break when used correctly. Electric sharpeners will absolutely churn these pencils up and should avoided unless you're using a brand of pencils with an extremely hard core. Lastly, use a regular lead pencil before sharpening your first colored pencil of the day. This will clean out any residual wax, making it less likely that your tips will sharpen unevenly.

The final piece of advice for those who're frustrated with broken tips is this: after sharpening, put the tip of the pencil on your paper (watch that it's perfectly vertical) and press down. You'll need to use the right amount of pressure since too little will have no effect and too much will break the tip. However, when done correctly, it will compress the lead just enough to make the tip stronger and less likely to break.

All-in-all, once you're ready to get stunning results after learning the ropes on a cheaper set, Prismacolor truly is the best choice. They are such a blast to use, because they allow total control over color saturation and blend flawlessly for a stunning end result. Just keep in mind that if you purchased these and are new to the craft, patience and persistence are key. Focus on how hard you're pressing, especially when holding the pencil at a sharper angle, and don't underestimate how important the right sharpener and sharpening technique are when using a professional-grade colored pencil. :)

Good luck and have fun! :)","Hands-down, the very best brand for experienced artists.",1466985600,10,

Looks and feels the same as the nib in Pelikan Pelikano Junior. The feed also seems to be the same, but I have not tested if they are interchangeable or not.

The grip is ergonomic and is comfortable in an adult hand. However, the grip is NOT made out of a rubbery material. It is made out of the same matte plastic as the barrel and the cap. The shape of the grip is NOT simply triangular. One face is a little bit more shallower than two other facets that appear to be deeper.

The ink included is blue, but is not a bright blue. More of a tamed / conservative blue. It is similar to watercolors. During writing, while it is still wet, it looks brighter an darker. Once it is dry -- it appears slightly faded.

The nib creates a very-very uniform line, which is great for writing but not for sketching. The barrel is comfortable. Not too thick and not too think. I usually don't post the caps, hence I don't care whether they post well or not. The plastic of the cap seems to be sturdy and not thin.

I love, love, love the fact that the cap does NOT have a clip. How many people really use clips these days? It used to be that engineers always used clips to keep 4-5 pens in their pockets, but with the proliferation of electronic devices who needs them anymore? Without the clip the design of this pen is awesome! It looks solid, uniform, like a twisted speedy torpedo! The cap, by the way, is a snap-on cap, and does not have a tread inside. It does have a plastic insert in order to decrease the amount of air around the nib.

In my tests it did not start as quickly as Pelikan Pelikano Junior, but I am guessing that the nib needs some ""break-in"" period. Also, after I've removed the cartridge it was not writing as long as the Junior, but who cares about these details? The nib feels a little bit stiff, but again, maybe over time will be softer.

The ""ink eradicator"" marker that is included in this package has two tips. One with a special chemical to make the written characters disappear and another tip with the same colored (but most likely with a different chemical composition) ink. As I understand, the clear chemical acts on the standard ink, but then you cannot re-write with the standard ink on the same spot and must use the ink from the marker. That ink, however, does NOT disappear under the corrective tip.",Love this trendy design! Great for writing. Will not roll off the table.,1452038400,,

Now this Lexmark that I purchase for 59.99 at Target.  Their CD works with Snow Leopard.  HP's did not.  Installation was super easy.  Got everything I wanted for 59.99.  I think Target's regular price is 80 dollars.
Have not hooked it up wirelessly yet.  Am planning to add a laptop, and get a router.  This system works well with the usb cable provided.
Loading paper, a very nice feature.  On my old Canon, which I have replaced with this, the paper could be loaded, but not  in contact with the roller heads that pull the paper in the machine.  The Lexmark has an almost foolproof loading process.  The paper drops into the slot, and you just know when it is in right.  Also has a double slider to adjust for the size of the paper.  Everything is centered with the sliders, so that 5 x 7 photo paper is dead center.  Makes printing easier.  Pictures come out lined up perfectly.  The pictures are beautiful,  but they do look a little like fine paintings instead of photos.
All this for 59.99.  I have extra ink cartridges on the way from Amazon.  I love Amazon.  Unfortunately I had to return the HP to them.  Target beat Amazon on price for the Lexmark.

Obviously, I need organization.

So I used sheet protectors to save each good recipe, but sheet protectors made the stack even taller.  No binder I owned was big enough and sturdy enough to contain an organized set of treasured recipes  until now.

This binder is plenty big for years to come, even with the added bulk of sheet protectors and dividers.  The hinged rings that hold the sheets are easy to open, but with this binder, I don't need to remove the recipe.  I can actually use it in the kitchen because it opens out flat.  Ive put a cover sheet in the pocket on the front, so its easy to recognize.

5.0,False,"11 3, 2014",ASK1DQ3IS9BHN,B008YL10SS,,S.L.,"Love these Noodlers inks.  This one is smooth as silk and a nice shade of dark green.  I have used it in several pens ranging from an antique Parker Vacumatic Junior to a cheap but functional JinHao and it functions well in all the pens I've put it in.

The shade of this ink is very nice for any non-frivolous application like business use.  It's not gaudy or tacky, it is a very decent darker green color of ink that can be used for anything from hand written correspondence to note taking to doodling.  I don't draw so I can't really address it's suitability for artwork.

This is an exceptionally penetrating ink, depending on what paper you use you may find that it goes completely through the paper to whatever is behind it.  I use this particular ink for signatures and hand cancelling checks, and it is an excellent ink for those and any other permanent, archival applications.

I have used this ink on good Rhodia paper and it doesn't go through that, on a high quality Fox River Bond 25% Cotton it goes through enough to render the back side of the paper unusable but it doesn't soak through to the blotter behind that paper, it performs about the same on regular copy paper and on cheap notebook paper it goes completely through the page to the page behind it and blots/soaks through to that page.  This is with a medium nib pen that writes with a fairly heavy wet line so YMMV depending on the pen and how wet it writes.  If you want to put something on paper for eternity (well, as long as the paper survives that is) this is a very good choice of ink.

Even in several different pens on a wide range of papers I haven't seen any feathering or blotting effect to the script line.  It goes where you put it and stays there, it doesn't go where you don't want it except for the penetration I've already covered.  For my purposes the penetration is a plus.

I experimented with this ink by leaving a page written with this ink in the sun for several days and I can see no fading at all.  This was done with the Fox River Bond paper previously mentioned and that is an archival quality low-acid paper.

I don't know how Noodlers accomplishes this but although the ink is highly penetrating it's also very easy to clean up.  Once it's on paper it's there for good but if you spill some or get some on your fingers it cleans right off with no trouble and no residue.  I haven't gotten it on any clothing or cloth so I don't know about cleaning it off that but it does come off other things so well I'd think that if you cleaned a spill on cloth while the ink was still wet you'd have a good chance of removing it completely.

This ink has earned a permanent place in my fountain pen stable.  It and the other Noodlers inks I've tried and own are every bit as good as the Pilot/Iroshizuku  and J. Herbin inks.  They do not clog my pens at all so if you've heard anything to that effect it's not so.  Really, considering that Noodlers inks are generally around half the price of those Pilot and J. Herbin Anniversary inks the main issue is if you can find a shade of ink you like.  I'll still buy and use those more expensive inks but it's more a matter of them being a color that I like than it is anything to do with quality of the inks.  These Noodlers inks are every bit the quality of the best inks on the market and at a more attractive price.",Great ink if you want something that lasts.,1414972800,7,

Each year we use a three ring binder with added tabs to keep track of our work. After using other brands, I finally purchased an Avery binder one year and was happily surprised at how much better it held up than the other brands. Now, Avery is the only brand that I purchase and I order one each year as I am preparing for a new homeschool year. I like the ease of opening the rings, and the larger binders hold sooooo many papers. I also like the pockets on both interior covers; it's handy for keeping specific forms, calendars, etc at my fingertips. The clear view front cover is handy as well because it allows me to create a cover sheet for our binders (you can also download a template to use to create a spine label as well which is super-helpful to identify which binder you need from the shelf). The best thing I like about these Avery binders is that no matter that we use them on a daily basis, opening and closing them multiple times, the seams have not ripped like other binders have done. I like these so well that I use separate ones for household information, recipes, garden info, product information booklets and warranty info. I highly recommend these Avery binders and I will continue to use them in the future.","Quality binder, seams won't rip, hold lots of papers",1470873600,11,

This Palm has all the power and versatility of the Palm IIIxe --my previous favorite-- PLUS the wireless capability! You can e-mail anyone from anywhere and connect to internet services for ten bucks a month and that includes a lot of e-mail messages, but you can choose whether to subscribe or not. And you can have people reply automatically to another address so you don't use up your allotted kilobytes. Just imagine carrying an internet connection in your pocket. Besides e-mail service you can log in to a lot of services through ""web-clippings"", including amazon.com, weather, news, etc. And, of course, the more you use these services, the more you pay, but only if you go beyond your basic service rate. Again, for this price, who could ask for more in a Palm organizer? It's worth every penny you pay for it. Batteries?  Without a doubt, wireless services consume a lot of power, like cell phones, but 2 AAA batteries provide a reasonable performance. Even if you don't need wireless service, I beg to disagree with other reviewers, this is already a great electronic organizer.",Affordable and practical way to be organized and ON-LINE!,1002585600,8,

First impressions are that the Epson is considerably lighter than the Canon and requires a somewhat smaller amount of counter space (although both units are fairly large).  Where the Epson excelled for me was in the ease of connecting to my home office network.  It connected quickly and has maintained the connection for hundreds of prints.  This is in contrast to the competitive unit, which I could never get to work reliably on my home network, even after contacting Canon's technical support department (which is the primary reason I got rid of that printer and replaced it with the Epson R2000, as the Canon's print output was also excellent).

I've now printed about 200 photographic quality prints on the Epson and they continue to amaze me with their quality - comparable to a high-level photo lab.  I've made scores of 13 x 19 prints and they look great, especially on fine art media from Hahnemuhle (who, by the way, supply ICC profiles for this printer that are very easy to use in Photoshop and enable one to produce superior results).

So, based on my initial two weeks' use of this printer, I'm quite happy and very satisfied.

In terms of drawbacks, the R2000 gobbles ""Gloss Optimizer"" ink cartridges when making large prints at the printer's high-quality settings; I've already gone through two of the GO cartridges and one cyan as well.",Really great printer with excellent network connectivity,1383782400,,

Sometimes a soft copy isn't the solution, and you want to share a printed picture.

Whatever your opinion of printer consumables marketing tactics, don't underestimate the value that goes into the work printer manufacturers place into matching the performance of printers, paper and ink.

When all is said done, I enjoy more consistent results when the printer, ink and paper all came under the same brand.

I use this paper for snapshot quality photos in those situations when a hard copy print provides the extra user experience (or portability) that a digital image can't.

I especially like the fact that when it's used as an eraser, it doesn't leave any residue of itself on the paper that you must flick away and possibly smudge your drawing.

First of all, these pens are extremely comfortable to hold. They are light, and have a great grip. The grip is made of rubbery material, and it's not too thick. You can easily use them for a long time without experiencing discomfort.

They write smoothly and easily, and don't need much pressure. The ink colors are very bright and vivid, if not exactly the color of the barrels, which are more neon hued. The light blue and light green are much darker than their barrels (more like an ocean blue and a jungle green). They are very quick drying - they don't smudge at all, unless you brush over your words the instant you write them.

The tip size is perfect for taking notes on notebook paper, and they don't bleed through much. You can see a ""shadow"" of your writing through the paper, but that's all.

I purchased the Brother P-Touch 1880 after researching several less-expensive models, but I made my decision after I used the 1880 in our office. This particular 1880 has seen dozens of rolls of tape and has served the office well for a number of years. I figure if this unit could withstand this much use without any problems, it was well worth the money.

The 1880 comes with 1 free sample roll of laminated TZ231 "" black text on white tape. I recommend using the NARROW margin setting with the MAX text size. It uses 6x AA batteries, but you can save money by using rechargeable NiMH AA batteries. An AC adapter is available, but it is like carrying around a tether.

I've almost finished my sample roll and put the labels on almost everything. My laptops, desktop PCs, and even the Logitech G27 steering wheel are sporting several of the labels. I needed to label the functions for all of the buttons so I wouldn't get confused.

Pros: Easy to use, easy to install new cartridges - no ink is required.

Cons: Uses 6x AA batteries, recommend NiMH rechargeable or an AC adapter. The 1880 does use a lot of tape due to its standard design, so set the margin to NARROW and save a bit per print out.

Installation is as plug 'n play as it gets (I'm on a Mac, which is what this model is designed to work with).  I was scanning pages within 10 minutes of removing the machine from the box.  While the included software works with the machine to provide some powerful features, basic scanning is idiot-proof once the software is installed and the machine is connected via USB.  Insert the pages, press the scan button and in seconds the scanned image pops up on your computer screen, ready to be named and saved.  The scanner does a great job of detecting orientation, color vs. B&W, duplexing, etc.  It scans pages fast, and rarely jams (it handles even badly wrinkled and irregularly-edged source documents without fuss).  This is a great way to get rid of paper files.  I only wish I'd come across this particular device sooner.  If your prior experience with multi-page scanning has been limited to the (relatively) clumsy paper feed devices on typical multifunction printers, you'll be shocked at how much better a dedicated scanner like this one is.

As easy as the white board is to use, I still miss the look of the old slate chalk boards.  Of course, I do not miss the messiness of the chalk dust that used to get over everything.  I had no idea that there were black dry erase boards.  Now, I have one! I just received an Expo&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/black-board-and-neon-marker/dp/B003I5YFZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">black board and neon marker</a>&nbsp;combo.  I love it.

The black board now sits on the wall above my desk.  It attaches to the wall magnetically.  I can write on it with the neon markers that came with the kit.  They all show up well.  It looks like the black boards that restaurants use for posting the specials-of-the-day.  Post-it notes stick to it, as do magnets.  These cute black boards can be obtained separately from the markers.  They come in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/8-5-x-11-inch/dp/B002R5AE9I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">8.5 x 11 inch</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-x-10-inch/dp/B002R5AE98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 x 10 inch</a>&nbsp;sizes.

I tested the neon markers on the new black board as well as on my large white board.  The neon markers show up well on black, but only the pink color can be read easily on the white board. The neon dayglow on black looks great. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/neon-markers/dp/B0034792TQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">neon markers</a>&nbsp;can also be purchased separately.

Since I am a scientist after all, I also tested the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/white-board-markers/dp/B000I7Q8S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">white board markers</a>&nbsp;on the black board.  I tried blue, red, green and black.  Although, they are great on the white board, they are not at all visible on the black board.

The one necessary item that did not come with the combo kit is an eraser Fortunately, I already had a standard Expo&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/eraser/dp/B002VCWU76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">eraser</a>.  It erases the neon writing easily.  A paper towel also works.

Altogether, I am very happy with my new black board, the old white board, the markers, and eraser.  I cannot wait until they come out with larger black boards, so that I can satisfy my retro leanings with the new technology.",Works Well on White Dry Erase Boards,1278979200,,

It has a contemporary linear design made of easy to grip special resin, their proprietary plastic that has a warm, soft feel but retains its hard and shiny finish. No other pen company matches this material. What really makes this pen special is the treatment of the metal trim, namely the clip, rings and ferule where the point comes out. These are not coated in shiny gold or platinum like other Mont Blanc pens. They are instead plated with Ruthenium. This renders the metal trim shiny but dark, somewhat difficult to describe but incredible in appearance. Personally, I don't like fancy pens that really look fancy and pricy. When the pen is in your pocket it does not stand out as a silver or gold shiny object, rather it is understated in your pocket and really, really eye catching when out in your hand or on the table.

Truly, nothing beats a Sharpie.  I have a special stash of Sharpies that my kiddos aren't allowed to use, as they don't treat them with the loving care that they deserve.  Im kinda joking but I truly do treasure them.  I recently purchased a set for each child and they were ecstatic, so I know Im raising them right.

PROS
{{COLOR CONSISTENCY}}  Sharpies ink is vibrant and Im always impressed with how consistently they apply onto paper.  Unlike other brands/markers, you don't get the lines when your stroke or the ink overlaps.  Its just smooooth.  My penmanship and artistic abilities just look better than they really are.  Who doesnt like that?

{{COLOR OPTIONS}}  There are so many colors to choose from across all the various packages.  I have purchased 4 different sets and have a plethora of colors.

{{LAST A LONG TIME}}  Sharpies last forever.  Likely due to a combination of the cap securing attaching to the marker and the marker itself.  Ive had Sharpies that are well over 5 years and still work like new.

CONS
{{COST}}  Sharpies can be expensive and feel like an investment compared to the prices of other markers.

{{THEY BLEED}}  My family has been coloring with Sharpies on heavy stock paper and bleeds through, to the point that you can see the complete image on the other side.  It has not gone through the paper and onto the surface however I suspect it could with thinner paper.

{{THEY STAIN}} This is the blessing and the curse of these markers.  Watch children carefully.  These are not your washable Crayola markers.",Continuing to feed my Sharpie addiction,1519171200,,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UsAiZOl3L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MKBPlCFgL._SY88.jpg']"

It's small, quite printing doesn't even sway the table at all. Set up was fast and easy on my iMac. I didn't need the included software. It automatically connected from the ""Printers & Scanners"" area of System Preferences after I connected the printer to my wireless network -- which was also a breeze with the LED touchpad display.

One of the features I like best is actually when it runs out of paper. Usually not my favorite thing -- but when this happens to the Epson XP-830 the paper tray automatically opens! I think that is very cool. Just add some more and you are back in the printing business.

Scanning documents is also fast and easy. If you have several papers you can load them on top and chose whether or not to combine them into a single PDF or individually. Scanning photos into .jpg (or other formats) is also easy and the results are spectacular.

And of course the Epson XP-830 also prints -- and does so magnificently. I cannot tell the difference between copies made with a laser printer. It's that good.

The size is a bit excessive, but good for FPS and things like that. It allows you to continue turning for a long time without having to reset the mouse position, which is great if someone is trying to evade you or something like that. (Well over 360 degrees.) It is also great if you have dpi switching on your mouse, so at slower more precise movement ranges you will not hit the edge.

Tracking is amazing. I thought my old cloth mat had fairly good tracking, although a bit worn, but this is much better. This is my first hard mat so can't really compare it to other hard mats. The mouse glides very smoothly but you can feel a sort of drag even though it does not affect mouse movement. It was disorienting at first but after about a day of use I got used to it and is no longer much of an issue. I think it has sort of a fine grain to it to offer some resistance for more control, so it is likely actually a good thing.

The color is terrible. It is a bleak grey. I don't know if that somehow helps tracking or something, but it looks really bad. I would have preferred black, but no color options.",Works Well,1352073600,,

-outdoor teak furniture
-wood children's toys
-red clay/ ceramic statue
-antique upholstered wood chairs (indoor)

In the case of the teak furniture (which is completely exposed to the weather and receives regular use), the glued pieces have held up perfectly with no signs of softening glue, separation of the repaired area or discoloration. These repairs were performed about three weeks ago and still look perfect.

The wood children's toys are an all wood train set that had various pieces knocked off by regular toddler abuse and occasionally being accidentally left outside in the elements. The ProBond repairs are stronger than the original glued pieces and have held up better than any of the original glue work in these toys.

The ceramic statue is made of a low grade red clay that is rather fragile as far as ceramics go. It is a somewhat primitive piece that also fell victim to our Toddler's antics. The Probond created a clean tight repair that feels very secure. I suspect the repair may be stronger than the original clay.

The wood chairs, while high quality had several glued joints that were coming loose with regular use. The Probond also made quick work of re-securing the loose arms and rolling brass casters on these chairs. There is no play in the repairs. Of all the work I have done with the Pro-bond, it is probably the arms of these chairs that receive the most stress, but the repairs are holding up perfectly.

The pro-bond is also easier to work with than most other glue's I have tried. While I would not call it thick, it does stay in place without running or dripping. It is really a very well balanced consistency (not too thick and not too thin) that works well when you only need a dab *or* when you need a big glob. Now that I have this, I don't know what I am going to do with all the other bottles of glue I have in the house. This effectively replaces most of them. Highly recommended!

01 Do the pens write? - You bet. In the past, I have purchased a box of pens that included dried out pens mixed among good pens. I'm not sure how that happens but since then I always check every pen. I checked all twelve of these pens and they all write.

02 Do the pens write well? - They sure do. The pens write very smoothly and consistently produce a solid line.

03 Do they leak? - No way. I have only used each of the twelve pens for 2-3 hours but I have not experience any leaking or ink dribble.

04 Can you refill these? - No these pens are not refillable.

05 Are they a good value? - Yes they are a good value. I checked around at a couple of the big office super stores and found that these pens are in the same price range as other brands of gel ink pens.

With this new X-Acto, I sharpened 48 pencils, plus 8 dozen brand-new pencils without the sharpener ever getting hot to the touch. It literally takes about 2-3 seconds to sharpen a new pencil. As far as noise level - I would say it is comparable to other pencil sharpeners in its class, not necessarily loud, but noticeable when in use. I had the Stanley for about 2 years, and the newness wore off quickly. It didn't quite sharpen as fast as it once did, and I believe it got louder as time passed. It also burned out more often, but don't get me wrong, for a quick sharpen it still worked. With Stanley, I could get through about 30 pencils before it would get hot, burn out and automatically turn off.

As a future teacher and current after school program director, the smart stop and blue LED light really excites me! Gone are the days of students sharpening their pencils to nubs. This pencil sharpener has the smart stop and the LED. The LED illuminates when the pencil is sharp, and the smart stop completely turns off the motor when the pencil is sharp. The only way you can continue to sharpen is by either breaking the lead to re-sharpen it, or continually sticking it the sharpener and taking it out. The sharpener has lost its appeal to students who just want to play or waste time.

The only thing I don't like about this sharpener it the lack of traction. The Stanley did have little suction cups on the bottom to keep it from moving while inserting pencils. This sharpener has little rubber feet, but still moves around if you don't hold onto it.

Also worth noting is the technique of twisting the pencil while it is in the sharpener. I've noticed for most newer electric sharpeners, if you don't give the pencil a bit of a twist while it is being sharpened, the wood will surpass the lead, which holds true for this sharpener as well.",I am glad I spent a little extra on this X-Acto - ...,1416096000,,

This laminator with the Scotch pouches creates a laminated coating that is hard like an ID badge. My first year I had to re-make labels for my classroom library book baskets several times in the year. Since laminating them with this system, I have not had to remake them at all.

This year I have been experimenting with SCOOT and Task Card Sets. This laminator is perfect for those. When I use the school laminator.

While I am switching quite a few of my magazine subscriptions to digital, I still get a few at home. With those magazines and the copious amounts of junk mail we get I wanted a way to make the prep work for my old magazines to go to the thrift store or hospital waiting rooms without black marker scribble or big sections cut out to keep account and address info safe and secure.
This stamp does exactly that! It takes a bit of a learning curve to find the exact spot the stamp covers as the opening is a bit larger than the stamping area, but that doesn't take too long.
The number one thing I learned is it takes the ink a few minutes to dry on 'glossy' magazine covers, so if not careful you WILL wind up with black ink on your fingers. You have to lay the magazines out and let that area dry until there's no shiny spots on the stamped area.  Also some printed labels still can show through if looked at with a bit of sideways light, but by far most do not. The ink works best on paper printed addresses but after drying, glossy is just as good and you can not see your address info at all with the pattern of the stamp.
So magazines solved, and the junk mail, it gets shredded.
I recommend this if like me you want to save prep time with magazine recycling and mailing address security.",Works great! Hides info just as it supposed to.,1423526400,,

Many state it is small but I thought it was quite sufficiently sized for a portable travel writing desk.  So, like Goldilocks, this box size was ""just right"" for me.  I use pen and ink washes and wanted this box to place my bottled inks (I prefill with the washes before a sketch outing) inside while drawing outside, to not worry about spilling outside the box!  I had that happen once while on vacation and it was not a pretty sight.  Did not want to duplicate the experience.  This box will keep the ink contained in case of spillage and it is a nice sturdy/heavy box to also make me feel more secure about keeping my inks upright while in use.  The added bonus was the slant desk to hold my sketch/watercolor papers. I didn't even have that in mind when I purchased, I was more concerned about ink storage.  The hinge is not the sturdiest and I expect to replace it.  However, if this truly were an antique wood folding desk, I would be surprised if there was a functional hinge at this point.  So, I don't mind.  I appreciate the imperfections which again, seem to keep true to a reproduction of an antique writing box.  I read the description thoroughly to know what I was getting so I am not disappointed in the least.  As stated in other reviews, the drawer is removable and a Moleskine can be stored in that space.  The paper storage divider is also removable.  Hopefully I will remember to post photos to show how I am using it when I do my ink washes/sketches outdoors.  It is heavy, but I wanted the sturdiness, I do not plan to go hiking with it, it is more of an urban sketch situation for me.",I love this box for my needs,1469318400,3,

I received it on a Sunday, so I grabbed a large stack of Newspaper inserts that would be equivalent to 30 pages of paper (if not more) and immediately tested it. It stapled them easily. I also stapled them by holding the stapler vertically in my hand. No issues. I did notice that the staple seemed to be tighter and flater than most staples. It didn't ""stand out"" as much. This is due to the ""Super Flat Clinch technology"". It looks really nice and is great for school work or proposals.

The stapler is a little heavy because it is so thick and well made. However, it should not be an issue unless you are planning on holding it all day long. It also has a nice, sleek design. This is a stapler that you could leave on your desk without it looking tacky. It came with a small box of 30 staples. This is enough to fill up the stapler once.

Our plan was to distribute 250 CFL (compact fluorescent) light bulbs free at our town's community day (sort of like a street fair) in order to encourage people to use the bulbs to reduce electricity use.  CFL light bulbs can save about 75 percent on electricity over incandescent bulbs.  For the 250 bulbs, we calculated that for 8000 hours of use and an electric cost of $0.10/KWh the total savings vs. 100 watt incandescent bulbs for all the bulbs would be about $15,000.  There would also be a saving of 94 tons of carbon dioxide emission.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avery-Address-Labels/dp/B00004Z5SN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avery Address Labels</a>&nbsp;were a good choice for adding a label indicating the savings for using the bulbs and our committee's name.  The question was how to get the information printed on the labels.  At the Avery web site, I found free software, DesignPro, which makes it possible to produce label designs for different label sizes.  I downloaded the software easily and got started on the design

For the labels, there were about a dozen pre-made templates for the different size labels.  I chose the template that matched my labels.  Using DesignPro was a little like using PowerPoint.  I was able to cut and paste a graphics image, add the appropriate text, and choose a font for the text.  A test run on my printer produced a beautiful matrix of labels.  The only problem was to find out which side of the label stock had to be up.  I can never remember.  After an up/down test, I had my sheets of labels printed in no time.

Our community day give-away was a big success.  Our free light bulbs lasted about four hours.  We were able to peel the labels from the printed sheets easily. There was enough time to peel and apply the labels as we gave away the CFLs.  One surprise is that we had to have a sales pitch even for give-aways.  The other surprise was that many people had never seen CFLs before.  I am now a big fan of Avery labels, but I recommend getting the free software to make them work.",Free Software Makes the Labels Work,1280275200,,

The instruction sheet for assembly and installation is entirely visual, consisting of line drawings, directional indicators, and exploded views for each of the 12 steps.  There are no verbal instructions or clarifications.  Initially, this looked dangerous but each step was adequately explained and each of the steps was logical and clear.

There are still ways to get hurt.  Care should be given when removing the cardboard piece that separates the moving parts of the arm mechanism.  The spring in this device is very powerful and can cause the arm parts to snap together, becoming an effective ""mouse trap"" for fingers.

The adhesive strip on the top side of the attachment rail is strong enough to hold the rail in position under the table/desk top while screws are being attached.  This was greatly helpful although it was important to position the rail in the correct position the first time.  It was also helpful to have a carpenter's square to assure that the rail was perpendicular to the front edge of the table/desk.

All of the other parts were also easy to install.  Attachment of the front bumper bar that keeps the arm mechanism on the rail was straightforward.  Be sure that the bracket overlaps the end of the rails, and that the flat vertical side faces the front of the table/desk.  The guides for positioning keyboard and mouse cables are of two types.  One is a clip that slides onto the adjustable arm that supports the keyboard.  The other two have adhesive backing and may be positioned in any convenient location depending upon desk configuration.  Step 8 illustrates suggested location on the arm mechanism, but these might also attach to the under side of the table/desk.  The mouse pad may be attached on either right or left side of the keyboard platform, depending on preference and or ""handedness.""

My husband measured all of these parts for me because this item does put you back away from your desk a distance and you need to have the space for it.  The keyboard platform may be adjusted for height, for distance from table/desk edge, and for rotation in relation to the edge of the table/desk.  In the ""closed"" position, the platform stows completely beneath the front edge of the table/desk with the bottom of the platform approximately 3.5"" lower than desk top.  When positioned in its highest position,  the platform for keyboard is 2.5"" below the desk top and the mouse caddy is 1.5"" below desk top.  This makes the entire device much lower than you would think, but somehow this causes less strain on the lower back after hours at the computer.  When it is in this position, the keyboard platform extends 12.5"" in front of the desk edge.  The greatest extension in the upper position places the front edge of the keyboard platform 16.5"" in front of the desk edge.  In lowest position, the keyboard extends only 10"" in front of the desk edge.  The mouse caddy may be adjusted in relation to the keyboard by positioning the sliding attachment and also by rotating the caddy.  The 8.75"" diameter of the caddy seems adequate for the majority of mouse movements.

The keyboard platform is sturdy, and the wrist support padding at the forward edge allows for good support.  Non-skid pads keep the keyboard in position, even when the platform is tilted away from level.  The angle of the platform may be adjusted to elevate the wrist pad above the normal position, but not lower than normal.  The Keyboard manager is versatile and allows for a good range of user adjustment.  It supports the keyboard securely and affords excellent wrist and arm support.  The mouse caddy is conveniently located, and also feels very secure in use.

Overall, this product is well engineered, and installs in a straightforward process.  The design and the quality of materials suggest that this device will provide good service over time with minimal maintenance.",Ergonomic design gives relief immediately!,1270857600,,

5.0,False,"04 28, 2009",A680RUE1FDO8B,B001OATBEQ,{'Format:': ' Office Product'},Jerry Saperstein,"I bought my first OCR (Optical Character Recognition)machine in the mid-1980s. As I recall, it cost me about $15,000 and was about the size of a washer/dryer combination. It was slow, prone to jamming and the results were mediocre.

  Twenty years later the breadbox sized GT-S50 puts that first machine totally to shame. It took only a few minutes to install the necessary software on a computer running Windows Vista Home Premium (64 bit). Another few seconds to drop in a stack of 79 pages (a little over the specified 75 page limit of the Automatic Document Feeder (ADF)). A couple of mouse clicks to select the desired output format and folder and one more click to start scanning.

  This machine is blisteringly fast, operating at least at the 25 pages per minute specification. The ADF feed is very smooth. A couple of pages had ""chads"" where I removed staples and a couple of pages were slightly crumpled, but the GT-S50 kept right on plowing along. Image output is buffered, so the paper feeding part finishes before the conversion to images occurs. The Abby FinePrint Reader works somewhat slowly, but it is acceptably accurate. I did not try the supplied Nuance PaperPort 11SE software because my experience with the last couple of versions has been bad. I will be using it with Adobe Acrobat in the future and I have no doubt that it will work because Epson has included both TWAIN and ISIS drivers.

  There is a fairly broad array of options for scanning text and images. The menu driven scanning software is simplistic and, I think, idiot proof. There are numerous output quality options with little guidance on which to use, which may lead some beginners astray. The menu is in some ways simplified to too great a degree. It is not immediately clear, for example, how to designate your output folder or how to change the default name of the output file.

  In terms of performance, the GT-S50 is built for business needs. It is far superior to the common multi-function machines found in many home and small offices. Setup, as noted, is very fast and very easy.

  The machine itself is very well designed. The output tray slides into the main body and the ADF tray folds over the top, serving as a dust cover. While small, the machine is fairly heavy, though you can ""lug"" it from location to location without difficulty.

  In all, this is one very sweet machine. It is fast, simple to operate, delivers high-quality results, moderately portable and apparently built to last. It will handle not only regular sized paper, but business cards, odd-sized items in a separate carrier sheet and items 8.5 inches wide and up to 36 inches long.

  Anyone familiar with professional document scanning software will instantly realize that not every bell and whistle is provided. Far from it: the included software covers the basics and not much more. But the fact is that most people will not miss all the capabilities supplied in professional scanning software.

  I am very impressed and hope to quickly convert the contents of my filing cabinets to PDF files in the near future with the able assistance of the Epson WorkForce Pro GT-S50 Document Imaging Scanner. It is a very slick, very useful, very sweet machine.

I rarely have to go into a PDF and make a correction to right a paper so you can read it.

Set up is very simple - and the ""START HERE"" guide is very well written with clear illustrations. I set mine up to work with my MacBook Pro and my wife's MacBook over our wireless network here at home.

The included installation CD works for both Macs and PCs - and yes, Mac users you will need the CD (or you can go to Kodak's website). There is an option to set up the printer using a USB cord - though note that a USB cord is not included with this printer.

After you install the software you'll get a prompt that a firmware update is available, along with updated software to use the printer, called KODAK AiO Home Center. If you want to skip the extra step, you can download the latest version at [...] or copy and paste this URL into a browser: [...]

The Kodak 5250 prints fast - even photos - but it isn't very quiet (which is fine with me but I thought you might like to know that).

The wireless scanning is a key feature for me, as I must scan all of my receipts and email them to my company's accountant when submitting my expenses each week. My previous printer was also connected to my home wireless network but I had to physically connect my laptop to the printer via USB to scan. What a pain in the neck! The Kodak scans and sends the images wirelessly -- and in a fraction of the time as my old printer; maybe 10 seconds per document.

This is a perfect little printer for your home office -- or for general family printing needs.

I'm probably going to get a 1-1.5 year supply of ink for less than half of what I used to pay for 1 cartridge. Can't beat that in my book. Just be careful, they can be a bit messy when installing/removing. Just use a paper towel to lay them on while switching, other than that no worries. Hope they are still available when it's time to get more.

The ink may either be lighter or darker depending on a variety of factors including quickness of writing, rate of ink flow from the pen, etc. This creates a nice effect that can tell a bit of a story as to the author's flow, state of mind, etc.

Altogether a great ink.

One of the problems I encountered when exploring the different colors is that they are not properly listed. You only get the name, the label art, and the bottle, which tell you nothing so far as the actual color of the ink.

For all those interested, color samples are available for all the inks on the Noodler's website: http://noodlersink.com/noodlers-ink-color/",Antietam; blood ink; and the Noodler's website for ink colors.,1432598400,,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OJ4CcSVkL._SY88.jpg']

There were two main factors which helped me make the decision to purchase this printer.  #1, it's highly rated on Consumer Reports.  #2, it offers wireless printing.  I have three computers in my home, and it's nice to have it in a ""central"" area.  Also, though I don't really do this, I'm sure it's nice to be able to print from your phone.

Currently Amazon.com has very little information listed about this printer, so I thought I would go into a little more detail. .  .

About ePrint
HP ePrint lets you print from virtually anywhere to an HP printer that supports ePrint. Once enabled, ePrint assigns an email address to your printer. To print, simply send an email containing your document to your printers' address. You can print images, Word and PowerPoint documents, PDFs, and photos. You can view and manage print jobs sent to your printer using your printer Job History that is available on ePrintCenter. Note: HP ePrint provides convenience printing. Documents printed with ePrint may appear different from the original. Style, formatting, and text flow may differ slightly from the original document. For documents that need to be printed with a higher quality (such as legal documents), we recommend that you print from the software application on your computer, where you will have more control over how your printouts appear.

This printer will ""duplex"" - Print on both sides of the paper.

Borderless printing

250-sheet input tray and 150-sheet output tray

If you're not using wireless, you can use Ethernet.

It says that it's supposed to use up to 50% less energy than color lasers.  Energy Star Qualified.

I had no problems setting it up on three computers (two Windows 7 and one XP)

I haven't had an inkjet printer in several years, but overall it works just like ones I've had in the past except that now there are three color cartridges and one for black.

I love not having to use cables and it allows you to put the printer where it doesn't have to be seen. The printer also looks good, has an off-white color.

This is not an itty bitty photo printer like my Kodak photo printer.  This thing is massive.  It is bigger than any printer I have ever owned, including our old clunkers from the early 90s.

One reason it is so big is because it can accomodate very large page sizes, all the way up to 13"" x 19"".  There are two separate paper feeds.  One holds photo paper up to 5"" x 7"".  The other tray holds all other paper.  It makes it very convenient for easily switcing between regular printing and photo printing (assuming you main print smaller print size photos).

The photos are really lovely.  I put the photo all the way up to my nose and couldn't see a dot pattern.  The quality is even better than my Kodak, which is a pretty decent photo printer.  The most important thing is to use good paper.  When I tried to use a lower quality paper the prints looked really dark and dull, but the same photos on the better quality paper were bright and vibrant.

My favorite feature is that this printer has separate cartridges for each color.  I love that!  It means I only have to buy the color that I am actually out of, rather than replacing a cartridge that is maybe only out of one color and the other colors are fine.

The speed is a little slow compared to my Brother laser printer, but I guess that is to be expected.  The quality is definitely comparable, though.

Honestly, I hadn't even considered a monochrome printer - color, we need color! Only, we really didn't.  My husband and I don't print very much. Most of what I print is shipping labels. So, I decided to try this Brother Laser Printer.

This was super simple to set up/install. My husband plugged it in, inserted the included CD-ROM into his drive and let it rip. The laptop searched the internet and downloaded the applicable drivers. It took about 30 minutes, so not quick, but there was almost no human intervention needed besides answering a few set-up questions.  Even better, when he went to my laptop, my 6 year old Vaio found the printer on its own!

Second, the printing is crystal clear. The difference between ink jet and laser is distinctly noticeable, and laser is superior.  I would rather have this laser in monochrome than my HP inkjet back in color. That's how good the printing looks.

I would have preferred a smaller footprint, but the size is comparable to most at home, personal printers. Further, we like that it has a drawer to hold paper, which a lot of home printers are skipping these days.  I'm not sure how long an ink cartridge lasts, but the standard yield cartridge says 1200 pages for about $45, which is again comparable to cartridges for other home printers. We were paying ~$40 for the color Canon cartridges and they didn't last long at all given how little we printed.

Overall, this is an excellent printer at a reasonable price (~$100 as of this writing).  Highly recommended!","Excellent printer, well worth the price.",1516060800,6,

It's very compact, taking up noticeably less counter space than my current Epson WorkForce 635 business all-in-one that we've had for 2-3 years.

It will do auto-duplex both printing and scanning, so two-sided printing, scanning, and copying all work out of the box.

Unpacking takes a little while as there are 15-20 blue pieces of tape to discover and remove, plus protective plastic sheeting over the shiny plastic, etc. The printer comes with typical documentation, a colorful fold-out setup instruction sheet (English/French), a quick guide (English/French) a CD ROM with drivers and the Epson software suite, and a big Specification Sheet that looks like it's designed to accompany the printer in a retail demo setup.

Power supply is entirely internal (cord only, no external ""brick"" or ""wall wart"" supply. You plug it in, press the power button, and the display panel motors itself out to look up at you (the output tray is also motorized, so no more forgetting to pull it out and dump your output all over the floor). Other than the power button there are no controls other than the large color touch screen. There's a loud ""beep"" each time you touch the screen, but there's a ""sound"" setup menu to turn that off which is nice.

For interfaces you have WiFi 802.11 b/g/h, Wi-Fi Direct, RJ-45 Ethernet 10/100/1000, Hi-Speed USB ""B"" connector on the rear, PictBridge (USB A) on the front, and a single memory card slot supporting SD/SDHC/SDXC. The specs claim MS Duo and CF support but the card slot is only labeled SD and I don't see any slot that a CF card would fit in, so that has me skeptical of the specs.

No USB cable is included. No paper is included. The included ink cartridges are ""-I"" versions (""I"" for ""Installation"" or ""Initialization"" I guess) which basically means they only have enough ink to prime the printing system and do a little printing before you're forced to go spend around $50-$70 for a set of standard or high-capacity ink cartridges, so factor that into the cost (as is true for virtually all inkjet printers these days).

It uses five inks, regular black (a potentially double-width cartridge) as well as C, M, Y, and a separate photo-black.

Paper handling is oriented around photo printing, with a 100-sheet regular input tray, a separate 20-sheet ""premium photo paper"" tray, and one nice touch is the inclusion of a CD/DVD tray for printing on inkjet printable CD-format media.

After loading the 5 ink carts and waiting through an initial 7 minute initialization sequence, the printer is ready to go. When it's turned off there's a blue-LED slow pulsing illumination around the power button (might be annoying in a really dark bedroom) the same indicator is used for indicating printer activity.

WiFi setup was straightforward, offering just about every way of configuring that you can imagine. Entering the WiFi password was a bet tedious as it uses an old-style phone pad entry (press an on-screen ""7"" button to cycle through ""PQRSpqrs7"" until you get what you want, which is annoying since hte screen should be large enough for a full QWERTY keyboard).

It's really set up to operate as a standalone ""PC free"" device. It has built-in support for oodles of features like local photo retouching, Google cloud print, file sharing via access to an SD card, home network sharing, and on and on. There are lots of additional little features like the ability to copy a CD label by placing the CD/DVD on the scanner glass to locate and read the label and then printing on a new printable disc media. You can do a lot with the printer.

Even before installing any drivers or Epson software, my Windows 8.1 laptop was able to see and print to the printer over WiFi with no difficulty. You can point a web-browser at the printer (or double click the device in Windows network view) and you can do some configuration, status reporting, firmware updates, etc. through this web interface.

There was an available firmware update which I let it install (took 5-10 minutes or so). During this process and other web interactions, the web browser (I'm using Chrome) would time-out and display a page-not-available message, but if you just sit and wait it automatically refreshes once the printer responds, so just relax and wait for it and it should come back in a few moments without needing to refresh manually.

Print quality looks great, and is fast. Overall I'm really happy with this printer and it's probably going to become my main printer here, certainly for photo-printing.

If photo-printing is something you do a lot, then this would be a great choice for a printer. If you're not a frequent user of high-quality photo paper and printing then this is probably overkill, not to mention the small 100-sheet input tray (limited by the second photo printer tray taking up the space). But this printer can do virtually anything: Print (two sided) scan/copy (two sided), fax (who uses fax any more really?), Talks to everything (Google, AirPrint, etc.), and has better photo print quality than a standard general-purpose all-in-one. This is really a great combination of features for someone wanting a photo printer that can also do everything else.

Funny story - I didn't know these existed til I bought a second Panasonic base station to use in the front of the house, and I noticed a tiny paragraph in the dense instruction book about buying an optional repeater TGA405B.  So I did, and now I don't need the extra base station in the front of the house.

I didn't find instructions confusing.  Bring the new 405B device and its cord to the room with your phone base station.  Have it ready to plug in.  Go to your base station and push the LOCATOR button for several seconds.  (I think if you press and quick release, it may make your lost phones beep, but if you hold, it puts the base station into pairing mode.)  Now, quickly plug in your Range Extender.  If it has never been used, it should automatically be in a blinking, pairing mode.  In a moment, its two lights should soon show GREEN (receiving input) and GREEN (sending out radio).  Now you can move the station to a different room, within the signal of your base station, and plug it in again.  It will BLINK GREEN when a phone is using it.

We have a Panasonic phone near the back of the house for the home office, back of house, and back yard.  With a Range Extender in the middle of the house, it gives excellent repeated signal into the front of the house.  I haven't yet discovered if you can walk across the house and the phone will be smart enough to switch stations or not.  Even if not, it's more convenient than two separate phone systems.

Note, there is a workaround to re pair: You repeat as above, but you hold a button on the repeater BEFORE, DURING, and AFTER the plug-in step.  This puts the repeater into pairing mode as if it was new. [I didn't write down what the pairing mode blinking color is - the manual might be wrong, but it doesn't matter too much.]  Before buying, I had some confusion between the TG, TGA, 405, 405B, etc, and also my Panasonic base station wasn't EXACTLY a listed base station compatible number, but it worked fine in 2 seconds.",Did the job just fine and paired in 2 seconds with our base station.,1421452800,,

The numbers and assorted buttons, as well as the LCD displays on the phones are large and very clearly marked. This is very helpful for people who cannot see the smaller buttons. The phones sound quality is excellent. There are many nice functions on this phone. My favorite is the intercom function that allows you to call any of the other phones. The redial function on the phone can store up to five of the last numbers that you called. There is an easy-to-access phone book that allows you to store up to 30 entries. There is the capacity to store nine speed dial numbers, and there are also three speed dial buttons available for frequently used numbers. The caller id works well, and, due to the larger screen, it is easier to see.

The answering machine works very well. The LCD screen tells you how many calls you have missed, and the messages are easily accessible with the touch of a button. The machine can store up to 59 messages for a maximum time of fifteen minutes. It is also possible to record a memo. You can use the recorded answering message that comes with this phone, or you can record your own. Of course, there is the option of remote access of the messages, too.

I works, and most importantly the cartridge is what it is supposed to be. Something that every competing cartridge I've bought on Amazon since November was NOT.

I buy only high capacity 2850B cartridges. Or intend to. This cartridge identifies itself as a 2850B in the both the ways that I can see using the printer's software. And my past experience with LD products was good. I'd get about 4000 pages and at least 2 months use out of these (printing dense text documents).

All, and I repeat ALL, toners that have claimed to be high capacity 2850Bs purchased on Amazon since Nov 2014 have proved to be standard capacity 2850As. Further, of late the quality is such that half arrive defective and entirely unusable. All appear to be made by the same manufacturer in China. They are sold as ""Bs"" but clearly identify themselves as ""As"" to my printer. And provide about one-third the life that the ""Bs"" do.

So, I am rather elated to have found an honest to goodness, real life high capacity ""B"" cartridge supplier.","A REAL High Capacity Toner, unlike all those Chinese-made fakes sold as high capacity",1438560000,,

I use them for multiple *hours* a day every day Monday through Thursday providing lessons in multiple classes at my college. I have to replace one or another color of marker from my set maybe only once a semester or so, if even that often. These markers last and last and last.

The markers mark smoothly and the ink dries relatively quickly and is usually not very smudge-prone at all. Yet their ink erases easily with a damp cloth/paper towel, or, in a pinch, with small errors, even with one's finger.

I pre-print discussion questions, diagrams, etc. onto ink-jet compatible transparency sheets, and then with the benefit of 3-M Flip-Frame Transparency Protectors (clear jackets that fit over the pre-printed transparencies), can use the Vis-a-Vis markers to interactively record onto the transparencies what students say as they and I work together doing theory-building, analysis and so on.  Before I run to the next class, I simply spritz the smooth, clear overlay sheet with water and wipe off the Vis-a-Vis ink and am ready to begin the process again with the next group of students.

Alternately, if there are things the students in that particular class said that it would be helpful to retain, I have a written record of their remarks right there on the marked-on sheet that I can easily photocopy or I can type the content into an electronic file.

I have found the cool colors such as the green, blue and especially the purple are the easiest to erase, even if I end up leaving my Write-On Wipe-Off marked-on acetate sheets unerased for up to years at a time.  The black Vis-a-Vis ink is a little bit harder to erase and/or might sometimes stain very faintly.  But that is to be expected when one leaves the ink sitting for months, maybe years at a time.  Even then, the black will erase off.  It just takes a little more wiping.

Yes, I am aware of PowerPoint.  I have done PowerPoint presentations before.  But I do not find PowerPoint to have anywhere near the capactity (without the use of a SmartBoard, anyhow) to allow me to keep a running log of student discussion contributions/arguments/attempted answers on display throughout a lesson, as is the case with using transparencies and the Vis-a-Vis wet-erase markers.

For actually getting in and rolling up one's sleeves to be *teaching* students, and working with them, rather than just lecturing at them, there is no substitute for these inexpensive, durable, fuss-free, long-lasting, high quality wet-erase markers.

Tops has the sharpest lines, then National, and Ampad respectively. Thickness of sheets was very close with National being the thickest, 7 percent thicker than Tops and 9 percent thicker than Ampad. As you might suppose, it is more difficult to see the grid lines through the paper of the National than the other two, however all brands have grid lines visible through the paper. National is slightly darker green then the other two where the color between the other two is almost indistinguishable.  The most important thing is the look and feel of the paper and smoothness of the writing and I tried to be as objective as possible but it really comes down to preference. National feels the smoothest with a  sharp .03mm mechanical pencil, very close behind is Tops, and Ampad is noticeably worse in a side by side comparison. National again wins in the look and feel being more uniform and flat compared to the slight waviness of the other two, and less likely to buckle when erasing. Lastly, at the time of purchase Tops was $6.14 for 100 sheets, Ampad was $5.81 for 100 sheets, and National was 3.99 for 100 sheets all prices were as add on items where the total order must be $25 or more. Price aside, I think it's pretty clear that National comes out on top of the other two brands unless not having the grid lines show through as well is just a deal breaker. Tops is also very good and is worth paying a few cents more for than Ampad.","I am just picky about paper so I ordered three brands,",1473984000,4,

Frace,"I've previously avoided multi-function devices on the basis that, at least historically, they didn't do any one of the functions extremely well. Things like scanning were better handled by a dedicated flatbed scanner, and dedicated inkjet printers produced sharper text and better pictures. That being said, I'm very impressed with the WF-2540. I even liked it enough to recommend it for my in-laws, though they went with the nearly identical WF-2530 model.

Scan quality -- I have a old Canon CanoScan flatbed scanner than I can now get rid of. I'm very pleased with the resolution options and color quality, and I like the way the options such as ""Descreening"" are presented in the interface better than what my CanoScan offered.

Print quality -- My other inkjet printer is an Epson Stylus Photo, so it isn't really the best comparison. The image sharpness is excellent. Understandably the colors are a bit dull compared to the Stylus Photo, but that's understandable as this is a 4-color printer (my Stylus is 6-color). As for text, I've traditionally veered away from inkjets (favoring laser printers) because it tends to looks fuzzy, but I find the WF-2540 to be reasonably sharp and will probably get rid of my laser printer in the near future.

Fax quality -- Not a lot to say here. I sent a fax to myself at work and it looked good.

Wi-Fi/Networking -- This is actually one of my favorite aspects of this printer. It's great being able to use it from any computer in the house (noting that the driver does have to get installed on each computer to use the printer). And it's not limited to printing: you can also scan and fax via wi-fi from any computer, with the scan result being copied to your local machine. Also available is Epson Connect, which you can set up to print from outside of your network. On the most basic level, you can forward an email to your custom @print.epsonconnect.com email address and it'll get printed. Finally, the printer also includes AirPrint, which means that you can print directly from your iPhone or iPad, which also works as expected.

Driver and Installation (Mac) -- I always skip using the CD that comes with the printer because 9/10 of the time it's out-of-date, and this was no exception. I downloaded the most recent package from Epson and installed it. Important note: by default, all of the available software is not marked for install, and I very strongly recommend installing the Download Navigator (updater utility), as even though the downloaded driver was the most recent on the website, there was a driver update and firmware update available in the updater. After the driver was installed, a wizard takes you through the setup of the device, including setting your fax name and number.

Weaknesses -- The only things that could be better with this printer have to do with the installation and setup. First, as noted above, the Download Navigator (updater utility) is not installed by default, and even with the most recent package from the website there are additional updates available. Second, during initial setup, you have to join the printer to Wi-Fi on the printer's front panel, which means typing in your Wi-Fi password on the telephone input panel. Third, I can't find a way to get back to the setup wizard, so there's no easy way to change the header name or number for, say, the fax settings. All of the settings are editable via the front panel of the device, but that's not as user-friendly. Finally, getting to the printer application, at least on the Mac, is a bit weird in that it's launched via System Preferences -> Print & Scan (or Print & Fax in 10.6). Thus scanning (which is handled from the printer application in the Print & Scan System Preference pane) can be a bit non-intuitive until you realize where it's hidden (however, you can scan directly from the printer and it will dump the output on your desktop). The only other minor weakness is that I find some of the functions of the buttons on the front of the unit to be a little non-intuitive when copying and faxing, but I got used them after a bit of trial and error.",Does all of its functions quite well - love the wireless capabilities,1358294400,3,

These Aviditi boxes are all easy to assemble, a little folding like origami and your flat piece of cardboard becomes a box. It's easy, just fold on the creases . its all very well pre-cut. if you don't know what a box looks like before you start, well then you are in trouble.
I found it useful with this style of box, to not fold the two end tabs complete inside, like in the photo, they are suppose to fold all the way over and touch the bottom and a small tab fits into the bottom to hold in place. what i do is wrap my item to ship in reused brown paper i got from other orders. and put that in the box. the end tabs then partially fold to be on top of the item. when the box is closed this prevents any item that could get loose from being able to fall out of box and it then only takes one strip of tape, start at the bottom on one side, go up the side, across the top and done the other side to the bottom. put the tape half on and half off when doing so and then when done fold the other half onto the front of the box. this totally seals the box closed and will prevent any items from being able to fall out. I have not had a single problem in 6 years of doing this and i ship several every business day.
Their boxes come in many sizes, i have about 6 i use and that will fit a good portion of the items i need to ship in one of them. I prefer boxes over bubble bags as there is less change any item will get crushed or damaged. these boxes have provided good protection.
I have been using for quite a while and will continue to use this brand.

The Canon is superior in every way to every printer I've ever used.  Not only does it print nicely, it makes great copies.  The fax and scan functions are relatively easy to use, and most of the functions on the machine are intuitive.  Unlike my HP, it operates flawlessly with no vibrating, smearing, grinding noises, or any other problems.  I love the fact that you can buy the ink colors separately, and they're very inexpensive.  If you're used to shelling out $39 for an HP tri-color cartridge, you'll be happy to pay $7-$8 for each color and $12 for black.  I used to hate buying a new tri-color cartridge just because I was out of one color.  Canon puts so much more thought into how their products work than other makers seem to.  The one thing I do not like about it is that when I am making color copies, if I dally too long between copies (and that's not very long--maybe a couple of minutes), it reverts to black and white without signaling me.  I've ruined some expensive photo papers because of that, and I really wish they would correct that feature.

However it works great for printing & scanning, but it is slightly slow in copying. A lot slower than the Epson all in one that it replaced. That one was still going strong, but it did not sync well with my new iMac, so I gave it to someone with a PC that could use it.  I had an HP inkjet -- died within a year.

It counts seconds which none of my other digital clocks do and includes temps inside and out and date.  The temps show trending up or down although those displays are too small unless you're close to the clock.  You have to remember that the left temperature reading is inside and the right outside because the boxes telling you that are tiny.  Mostly that's not a problem since the temperature differences are a big clue.

The other displays aren't really needed except when you're setting the clock up to begin with.  It's helpful to have the time zone (only US) shown and the fact that Daylight Savings is set to operate automatically (set on).  It's also useful to know that the clock has connected to Colorado so you know that it will set itself as expected.  You do not have to set it, even to begin with as long as it's placed where it connects.

I really like that the remote sensor also displays the temperature and offers an occasionally blinking light to let you know it's working.  I have another that is apparently dead but with no display I fiddled with it a lot before coming to that conclusion. With this unit you know right away that it's operating correctly.

As with all these clocks, you always put the batteries in the remote first and then in the clock.  On the back of the clock and the remote those directions are repeated.  I have LaCrosse automatic clocks too, but the SkyScans please me more.  This is partly because the clocks use different frequencies to transmit the outside temperature so both work independently.  My two similar LaCrosse clocks both use the same frequency with no option to change it so there is conflict.  At first both worked from one remote, now only one does and even when activating the second and placing it in a different location only one clock will show the outside temp.  Both my similar SkyScans work great with their different remote sensors.

I've never had any trouble with these atomic clocks getting a signal from home, but there can be problems sometimes if the clock is in the city with many tall buildings and all manner of satellites on their roofs.  I tried one in my office building with no success.  I've also never had a problem with the remote sensor communicating with the clock until the battery runs down.  I understand that lithium batteries do better when placed outside so I use those.  When the remote battery gives out you have to change both clock and remote to get them to connect again.  The clock battery may be fine and just removing it and reinserting it may be good enough, but both have to be attended to together.

This is not the most attractive clock for my decor, but its features are the best by far so I am very pleased with it.",Best clock of this type,1421020800,,

Cons: I was not expecting some of the leather from the inside/rough part of the journal to flake off.  Best way to describe it is like the bits of eraser after you have erased something in pencil.

I tend to enjoy the sharp option just because the lead seems to last longer and making my writing look a little sharper as well.

This is easy to operate (batteries) and the shavings container is easy to take out and put back in. We have not had any issues with pencils breaking off in this and the sharpener does not work without the shavings case on it, which is a plus.

Simply put, one cannot do better than Epson's Ultrachrome color, though I think they've come out with something new. But Epson is the leader in printing technology, in my opinion. I use these for my R2880, which is something of another story altogether. The problem Epson has is lousy construction. Their printers aren't durable, however well they print, and they do that better than anyone. Would that their printer construction were as good. But my printer started falling apart was before its time. I've got all kinds of feeder problems. My understanding is that the newer models are sturdier. When I get some cash I'll try another one and hope that's the case.

Anyway, these cartridges are great and very easy to install. I'm writing about the Photo Black, but the same applies to all colors. Another downside to the R2880 is that manual switching has to be done between glossy and matte black cartridges. THAT can be a real pain in the you know what.

However, given that handicap, I will say that I found the instructions clear and concise, and in a relatively short amount of time, I was more than able to use the machine competently. (Since I was so new to the whole process, I did a ""test"" run before actually laminating a document I cared about! Which turned out to be a good thing, as I quickly figured out that inserting the pouch completely straight is important.) This device warms up quickly and has an indicator light to let you know when it is ready. As with other reviewers, I had the problem with the strong, burnt plastic smell just after the first use. After that, the odor was more tolerable. Being a first time laminator, I was disappointed that the unit did not come with any laminating sheets, so I had to purchase some which delayed the whole experience. I have read some of the reviews on Amazon, and have followed the advice of some that recommend cleaning the unit/rollers after each use. I think this is a good, compact unit, that does not take up a lot of storage space, However, as with anything, I would encourage those seeking a laminator to do their research and to compare prices and functionality of several competitive units before deciding to purchase.",Nice product for the price.,1397692800,,

There are some negative reviews for this printer stating poor photo print quality or subpar text. But this is due to the user not reading the manual which clearly explains that the supplied cartridges are for general use.  If you are going to print photos, then you need to purchase the photo cartridge for superb prints. If you want deep crisp text, then Cartridge #88 does the job.  So the negative reviews are not fair to HP or the prospective buyer.
This is a great little printer which can go on the road by either powering it through the car adapter or rechargeable battery (not included with the basic model)
Also, this printer can print from cellphone pics, and other handheld devices such as PDA (via bluetooth technology).  The photo's are clear, crisp sharp images
and the text prints are also good. Not a bad investment at all, just buy the proper cartridge for the job and you'll be a happy camper. Not a bad choice at all.","Great Portable Printer with optional WIFI, Bluetooth or Wireless",1228521600,291,

This printer is PERFECT for both.  Photos are printed crisp and clear.  Toner transfers exactly as it should.  The Brother high yield toner I purchased ($40) on Amazon notes it will make 2,500 prints, making this printer a very inexpensive way to print crisp copies in black and white.  I have a MacBook Pro and I'm updated to the newest software OS X Yosemite and didn't have a bit of trouble with setup, about 10 minutes and I was printing.  With that said, I do have some basic computer/wifi knowledge and understood the steps fully.  The easiest way to setup is to press the WPS/AOSS button on the back of the router & the wifi button on the printer and allow them to sync that way.  Now, I did change my wifi password on our router prior to setup and the Mac stopped communicating with the printer, but I checked the box that said ""share printer on the network"" in System Preferences, Printers & Scanners, Brother HL-L2340DW and I was back in business.
I will say the ONLY CONCERN and CAUTION I have with this purchase is that the printer arrived from UPS in the actual printer box.  It WAS NOT inside of an Amazon box.  I was home when it was delivered so it was not an issue for me, but for someone who may have it visible on their porch and not home, it could be a temptation for thieves.
*******UPDATE******* After a week of use, we changed wifi and it threw this thing for a loop.  I added the password manually with the display and buttons instead of connecting with WPS and that worked.  The printer also began to not respond while in deep sleep mode.  I used the recommendation by several on here by doing the following:
Find the IPv6-
1. Print the network configuration report from the machine:
Press the up or down arrow key to select Machine Info and press OK.
Press the up or down arrow key to select Print NetSetting and press OK.
2. On a computer connected to the same network as your machine, enter the machine's IP address in a web browser to open the Web Based Admin Page.
3. Click the Network tab. 
4. Click Wireless. 
5. From the left navagation bar, click IPv6 (wireless)
6. Next to IPv6, select Enabled. 
7. Click submit. /

Plastic cover: Very easy to slide inserts into, or any heavy cardstock you choose to use after you run out of the ones the box comes with.

We have gone through cheap electric pencil sharpeners time and time again. I finally figured we should spend some more and find a pencil sharpener that would last through more than a couple dozen pencils.
This pencil sharpener certainly gets the task done. I was also comparing it to some very expensive units (over a hundred dollars), but settled on this one because of the reviews. The first time I used it, I sharpened 120 pencils right off the bat. It cuts them VERY fast and the auto stop feature is great at preserving the motor and cutting head. Also with cheaper units, they tend to slide around a lot. This unit is quite heavy and has excellent grip on a table top which also improves it's sharpening capabilities. I would like to note that this unit is quite heavy and is very big.

Thompson,"I bought this printer from a local office supply as a last minute replacement for a fairly new Lexmark that was once again on the fritz - it was spitting out too much pink ink all over my prints, which kind of spoils the look.  Print heads were the problem.  For some reason, they kept wearing out on me and the printer won't print properly when that happens.  Shouldn't have to replace print heads every six months, which is what I was having to do with it.  My mother has had her Epson for years and not once has she had to replace print heads.

There is so much about this Kodak printer to like.  It is really nice to be able to use a printer you don't have to keep under constant watch while it's printing, which I had to do with the Lexmark.  I also like the fact that when a cartridge runs out, it immediately stops printing and tells you so.  My other one would just keep going and I'd come back to find funky colors or blank pages.  The Kodak also gives you ink levels in real time so that you know when it's going to run out if you're paying attention.  Hover your mouse over the little ink icons and it'll give you what percentage is left.

I've been using this printer for a couple of months now.  I print 30 copies a week of a church bulletin on two sheets of legal size paper, front and back, with both text and pictures. I did notice that the ink went pretty fast but then the copies were so dark, even on draft.  I lightened the font color and it does a little better but if you're printing pictures as well as text and the pictures have a lot of dark colors, the black is going to go a bit faster that you'd think.  Now, I'm getting about the same yield as out of the other printer's non-XL ink and the ink for this one is about half what I was paying for the other.  I notice that Kodak also has XL versions of the black and color inks and they're also about half of what I was paying for the Lexmark XL ink so I think this has been a good deal all the way around.",Better Than Lexmark,1332547200,6,

I was a little surprised at the size, a little taller than I was thinking, but the footprint is not all that bad for most spots that can support around 40 lbs.  The setup was pretty easy, it only took me about an hour to unpack, prep, and get it working over the network even wirelessly with my notebook.  At first I tried to search for the printer before I installed the drivers and it was not going too well, then after I did the driver install it actually runs through a search for IP printers and it found it, assigned an IP address, and set it to my default printer all in just a few seconds, so installation would have been much quicker if I would have known that.  I hooked the printer up with the RJ-45 cable going to my wireless router and all my computers can print from it just fine after installing the print drivers and finding the printer on each.

As for the quality, the unit itself appears very well built and sturdy using high quality plastics and engineering.  And the printouts are very nice, the black is dark and text very sharp.  The only thing I did notice is that the color in the ""photos"" that I printed were a little dull, but I'm used to a $500, 8 cartridge photo printer too, so most anything would be a little dull compared to that I suppose.

The only thing I have found wrong with it so far is the little quick guide/cd holder case that has sticky stuff on the back and is designed to stick on the side of the printer so you can find it easy, basically the sticky stuff only holds for about 10 minutes and then falls off.  So if they change the adhesive, just about everything with this printer would be just about perfect.  So if you are looking for a reasonably priced, high quality laser printer, look no further!",Very Nice,1222128000,8,

There is a guy on my Christmas gift list that has exceptionally good taste and insanely few wants or needs. Shopping for him is always a challenge  he is used to a level of quality that I generally cant afford and on top of that, he lives in an intellectual world that I am so far removed from that coming up with ideas for a gift for him is next to impossible for me. The ExcelMark Library Book Embosser was a total gift-epiphany!

This incredibly high-quality embosser is solidly built and made to last. Each part is precision made and functions exactly as it should. The operation is simple, fast, and delightfully effective. Raised impressions are clear and distinct with excellent detail.

I loved how easy the embosser was to order and have personalized. There is a Customize Now button on the listing that was super easy to use and the embosser was personalized quickly and accurately.

My hard-to-shop-for friend would never think to buy this for himself but will love being able to indicate ownership of the multitude of books that fill his life with such joy in such an elegant and upscale way.

I received this exceptionally upscale book embosser at a discounted promotional cost in exchange for an unbiased review and am thrilled to be able to give my friend a gift that meets his high standards for top-of-the-line quality in such a useful and functional present!","Excellent high-quality gift for my favorite bibliophile!

The polypro is supposed to be 10 times stronger than vinyl. Guaranteed for one year. Save your receipt.(I think it's a good idea to store it in one of the little inside pockets) . If the notebook fails call 800-541-0094, customer-care, for replacement.

I had always thought the notebook size referred to the width of the spine but evidently it refers to the height of the rings. In this case the ""D"" rings are 2 inches tall, the spine is closer to 2 3/4 inches. I think attaching the ring assembly to the back cover makes the notebook stronger. You might prefer a notebook with more flexible covers if you plan to carry it in a back-pack every day.

You can go to wilsonjones.com  for templates to customize the spine or covers of your notebook.

10 very pretty colors.

UPDATE.. Dang! I still like the binder but it didn't work for my purpose. I bought magazine holders with the intent of using the binder to hold magazines.

What else do I like about it?
(1) Works perfect. Every time, no problems. Very reliable.
(2) The keys feel good and it is easy to type fast.
(3) Wow factor. This is an innovative device that expands what
  you can do with your Visor without comprimising portability.
(4) Folds up nicely and tucks away in a sturdy outershell case.
(5) Compatibility. This unit is compatible with every application I have I tried it with; games, business apps and word processors.
The unit tri-folds and features an expanding keyboard track that allows you to click the keyboard into place once unfolded.
It is easy to install. You load a driver onto your desktop, Hotsync it into your Visor and then connect the keyboard.
There is a keyboard icon on your Visor that has an option to turn the keyboard on and off. At times I have had to reactivate the keyboard whenever I hook it up, but that only entails unchecking the activate box and then re-checking it.
The keyboard has a slide out docking station that supports the visor from the back side.
I bought my Visor to keep track of information and to access the web wirelessly. I quickly learned it was possible to access my spreadsheets and other Microsoft Office documents and be able to edit and save them on my Visor.
That, of course, led to needing a keyboard. I am good at the graffiti, but nothing beats the keyboard when it comes to a lot of data entry. I now carry this combo wherever I might have brought a laptop and it works very well.",Convert your palmtop Visor into a desktop: 5 Reasons to buy,1009065600,13,

I was hoping to print some large photos for framing and hanging on the wall, and needed large photo paper.  I like the 8.5x11 since it is easy to work with and fits the printer perfectly, it is hard to find a frame (other than document frame) for this paper, but I found a nice document one at Walmart that looks really nice (most photo frames are 8x10.  I put these in the printer (HP OfficeJet 8600), and printed my photos from iPhoto on my Mac, when I printed I selected HP Photo Paper for the paper type and hit print.  It took the printer about 2 minutes to print the entire page of full color (borderless), and for a test I ran my finger across the page, nothing came off and the paper was dry when it came out of the printer and there was no smearing (make sure you use proper settings or you might get smearing or wetness).  The print looked amazing and after framing it and hanging it, I am very happy!  Every printer is different, so be sure to make sure your printer supports photo paper and that you choose the right settings for photo paper when you print your document or image.  I highly recommend this and you can not find a better buy for Full size Photo Paper anywhere!!!",Beautiful Prints,1337040000,,

For some reason I have not thought about AMAZON for ink before, and it turns out they were the best price and I got it fast Prime shipped free. I have a brother MFC-J870DW multi-function (scan/copy/print/fax) and these carts work perfectly with nothing special being done other than using them. No tricks to get them to work. They have a built in chip and work like OEM including the ink status. Plus the carts are clear so you can look and see the ink.  At point in time I was actually using refillable carts and found that a waste of time and money, and sometime dyed fingers. This is so much easier. They work, they are very low cost, no reason to buy OEM or try to refill them.  I have been doing all the firmware and driver updates and so far LD has been ahead of any attempt by Brother to prevent their Chips from working.  All printer companies do this.  This is also why I do not buy a lot of ink at the same time. That way I get (hopefully) the latest Chips. Right now I am using the carts are bought months ago and all is well. Also, so far, as I have never seen (as others stated) and cart other than LD brand in the boxes I have bought. My guess in that regard, is that these exact carts are sold under various names and they might package those based on their stock in hand not to have carts age on the shelf.

As for printing quality these are just fine. I have found more variation in the paper used. Paper made specifically for Ink jets always looks better than a multi-use paper for all ink jet printers and all inks. So keep that in mind.

It doesn't tear and can't be easily bent or creased. The ones I bought have lasted well, so I know they're durable. The designs in this series are typically very colorful and attractive. The tassel is a nice finishing touch.

As a product, this gets five stars. As a deal, it gets three stars. I'm pretty sure you could go to any stationery store and get these for under $2. However, buying through Amazon does offer considerably more convenience than searching locally for bookmarks.

I would tend to buy this as a small gift item. For something like that, this is definitely recommended.",Excellent and attractive bookmark,1338076800,3,

My cell phone case includes a small ring.  I put a Twisty through the ring, and when I slide a finger or two through the Twisty, the phone is easier to handle with one hand, and, it's far less likely to slip out of my hand.

To be honest, I'd prefer to use split key rings for keys.  They've always been the standard for keys and they come in many different diameters, thicknesses and even different types of metal.  But the Twisty rings are perfect for 1001 odd uses.  It's good to have a few in the drawer.",Multi-Purpose,1197590400,13,

Enter the Whitmor Deluxe Rolling Utility Cart - I would marry it if I could!!!

Seriously though, this cart is amazing.  When it came it was in a box that towered over me (actually 2 boxes, because I ordered two hahah) but it was so simple to put together!  It is mostly already assembled, you just insert the axles and attach the wheels with the directions which are well laid out (I do suggest that you count the items that is listed to make sure everything is included, I had everything plus an extra carter pin, but for me counting to make sure I have all the parts is the standard first move!)  I have long fingernails and I didn't even break a nail putting this together!  Right now we only have the one put together, we left the second in the box and stored it for the future.

We have 5 steps up into our home and even loaded to the top with groceries the Whitmor Cart pulls up easily, the back wheel takes a lot of abuse here at my house and it is going strong.  I cannot explain how many steps that this has saved me and how much stress this has saved my back!
The cart rolls easily across our lawn and while I need help pulling it up the stairs, I don't think most people would have that much problem, I just have to be careful with my back.

it holds a LOT, the handle is padded, and it folds to the size of the back wheels to slide in beside my dryer in the laundry room.  A crafty person could even line it with fabric or mesh if they wanted.  I can imagine a lot of uses for it, winter is over here, but it would have been excellent for bringing in a few logs for the fire, if it was lined with mesh it would be excellent for use out in the garden, perhaps I will line it with mesh for just that use, mesh and velcro! tada!

I can't say enough good things about this cart.  I hope that something I said was useful for you, thank you for reading my ramblings! PS, it's worth every penny!",Loved it so much I bought it twice!,1456012800,5,

its nib is far superior to lamy in my opinion, however, i prefer the overall light weight and look of the lamy, as well as the the ink indicator.  but as a writer, feel of tip to paper, pilot smashes lamey.
